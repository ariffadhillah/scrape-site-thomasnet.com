Transducer Techniques, LLC established in 1979, designs and manufactures a complete line of load cells, torque sensors, special purpose transducers and related instrumentation. Transducer Techniques, LLC load cells are uniquely designed for weighing and force measurement in such diversified applications as process control, factory automation plus hundreds of other services in every field of science and industry. All transducer sensing elements incorporate bonded foil strain gages wired in a full wheatstone bridge configuration. 

Load cells are electro-mechanical transducers that translate force or weight into voltage. This change in voltage produces, in the read-out instrumentation, a repeatable deflection or indication that can be calibrated directly in terms of the load applied to the cell. 

An important asset of our load cells is their extremely small deflection. The maximum deflection of standard cells does not exceed .012"" at full load. This plus the fact More... that these load cells contain no moving parts, opens unlimited application fields. The inherent compactness of the cells minimizes installation problems. 

 The frequency response characteristics of our load cells are exceptionally good. The relatively low mass, and the small deflection under load, result in a high frequency response which emphasizes use of the cells in many services where other transducers cannot perform.

Markets served include aerospace, automotive, environmental, food processing, glass, instrumentation, medical, laser, optical instruments & lenses, packaging, pharmaceutical, plastics, pulp & paper, railroad, robotics, rubber, semiconductor, specialty machinery, textile & tire industries. Made in the USA.","Proportion-Air is the world's leading manufacturer of electronic air pressure and air flow rate control valves and regulators. Each product is custom made to your specifications after sharing your needs directly with our applications staff. Our competition builds thousands of products to fill their catalogs. Proportion-Air builds only electronic pressure and flow controls, built thousands of ways to meet each customer's exacting requirements.

Electronic pressure control valves:

Proportion-Air designs and manufactures pneumatic control valves for the most demanding applications: low pressures (0-2 inches H2O), high pressures (0-69 bar), high flow rates (0-85000 slpm), high resolution (+/-0.005% of full scale), shock and vibration resistant up to 25 G's, tolerant of condensates and lube oils, oxygen clean and oxygen compatible, vacuum calibrations, vacuum through positive pressure calibrations, and absolute pressure calibrations. Proportion-Air offers most products in a single loop model More... where output pressure is closed loop around an internal pressure sensor. Many products are offered in two loop models where a second external feedback sensor can be used to correct for hysteresis in pressure regulation for higher accuracy. Nearly any pressure and flow can be achieved and controlled when we introduce pilot-operated regulators.

 Electronic mass flow control valves:

 Proportion-Air manufactures an industrial quality mass flow transducer for air and inert gases. Flow is calculated based on differential pressure across an internal venturi. This pressure based flow makes the F-series flow transducer very fast (<10mS). The F-series converts flow rate into an electronic signal that may be directly used to measure flow rates electrically. The F-series is also used as a feedback signal to Proportion-Air pneumatic control valves to create a closed loop mass flow control package. Packages are available as low as 2-20 scfm (0.9-9.4 slpm) and as high as 25-250 scfm (708-780 slpm).

 Two other brands make up the Proportion-Air family:

 Burling Valve brand direct-acting and dome-loaded pressure regulators are designed for the process industries. All Burling Valve process regulators and valves are made in the USA and offer free application support, quick quotes, great lead times and custom engineered solutions. Back pressure, pressure reducing, differential and negative-bias regulators are all available.

 Protect-Air USA miniature safety regulators operation of pneumatic tools and compressed air systems. All Protect-Air products are intended to increase efficiency, protect employees, protect equipment and ensure cost saving production throughout all levels of the manufacturing environment. Our number one consideration is to offer customers added value through broad and deep product lines, knowledge, processing and world class customer service.
