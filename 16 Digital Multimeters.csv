Fluke, Extech, Sperry, AEMC, BK Precision, Amprobe & Wavetek Instruments for megohmmeters, ohmmeters, insulation testers, vibrating reed frequency meters, running time meters.","Vibrating Reed Tachometers (STANDCO)

Vibrating reed tachometers require no power source, so they are ideal for hazardous areas. In addition, they can be safely used on all types of enclosed equipment to accurately measure rotation without the need for contact with high speed shafts. They are economical since there are no accessories and they are virtually maintenance free. Instruments are thoroughly gasketed and moisture-proof.

Stationary Tachometers, Hand-Held Tachometers, Dwarf Tachometers

Type R Stationary Vibrating Reed Tachometers - These vibrating reed tachometers are designed for permanent mounting. They are fitted with lugs to suit the mounting brackets shown below. Enclosed in a gasket, splash proof case, these instruments have a white face with black markings. Available with N.I.S.T. certification.

Type H Hand-Held Vibrating Reed Tachometers - These units are designed to be held against the housing of the equipment being checked. They can also be permanently mounted if desired More... with 8400 and 8401 brackets. Carrying cases are available.

 Static Electricity Eliminators

 Magic Wand Static Neutralizer - The Magic Wand is the safe, cost effective way to eliminate the problems of static electricity in the printing industry and in paper, film, plastic, textile and rubber processing applications. Since it uses no complex electrical or mechanical components, the Magic Wand static neutralizer is low in cost and easy to install without changes in existing machinery. There are no maintenance or operating expenses. The absence of high voltage transformers and cables eliminates the possibility of shocks or sparks caused by faulty insulation. In addition, the Magic Wand static electricity eliminators emits no radioactive rays that could possibly cause health problems. Material being processed can not be damaged by the Magic Wand since there are no sharp points. The Magic Wand can be ordered in special lengths to fit your equipment without additional costs.

 Pocket Laser Tachometers

 The Model MT-1B Pocket Laser Tachometer is a compact and highly accurate industrial measuring instrument designed for ease of use and maximum versatility in the plant and field. With MT-1B measures total revolutions (REV), revolutions-per-minute, and length in yards, feet, and meters.

 Hand Tachometers

 Model MF-2 Combination Hand Tachometer

 Our newest precision tachometer with NIST Certification included.

 Using the latest in microprocessor technology, the MF-2 can be used as a non-contact or a contact tachometer simply by adding or removing the supplied slide-in adapter. It measures RPM from 1 to 99,999 as well as FPM, mPM and IPM.

Customer Focus

Johnstone Supply dedicates itself to providing the highest quality products and service to our customers. To ensure we can meet the challenges of a dynamic industry, our company quickly develops and adapts programs to fulfill customer needs on a national and regional scale, while our individual stores customize these programs for their local markets.

The Johnstone Supply Catalog

Ever-growing product depth and quality plus ongoing improvements to the Johnstone Supply Catalog guarantee its continued status as the best source in the HVACR industry for parts, supplies and equipment. Available both in print and online with detailed illustrations and specifications, the online catalog features more than 50,000 quality products from the top manufacturers in the business, with more added every day.

Industry Expertise

Johnstone Supply views education as an essential, powerful tool that gives our stores and their valued customers a distinct competitive advantage. More... Our Johnstone University program offers intensive technical and business seminars to store owners and personnel, ensuring we have the most experienced, knowledgeable and helpful counter staff in the industry. To make continuing education even more effective we have developed Internet courseware to bring product training and expertise to the staff at our stores anywhere in the country, accessible round the clock.

 For our contractor and technician customers, Johnstone stores offer numerous educational opportunities to help propel them to the forefront of their profession, including onsite, hands-on technical training classes and NATE certification both in-store and online.

 Unmatched Supplier Relationships

 The HVACR industry is in a period of tremendous change. Consolidation has become the norm rather than the exception, and small, privately owned businesses are quickly disappearing. The Johnstone Supply Cooperative is uniquely equipped to meet this challenge in ways that are beneficial to our customers. We pride ourselves on having close, mutually beneficial relationships with the top manufacturers around the country, making sure our customers have access to the best products at competitive prices at every Johnstone store.
