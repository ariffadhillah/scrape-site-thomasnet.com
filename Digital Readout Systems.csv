Products include button, through-hole, beam, and miniature load cells, reaction and rotary torque sensors, digital panel meters, hand-held indicators, bench top and multi-channel amplifiers, and high- and low-voltage transmitters. Available in variety of models, specifications, and features with plug and play options. Also offers data software and electrical and mechanical load cell accessories.

Transducer Techniques, LLC established in 1979, designs and manufactures a complete line of load cells, torque sensors, special purpose transducers and related instrumentation. Transducer Techniques, LLC load cells are uniquely designed for weighing and force measurement in such diversified applications as process control, factory automation plus hundreds of other services in every field of science and industry. All transducer sensing elements incorporate bonded foil strain gages wired in a full wheatstone bridge configuration. 

Load cells are electro-mechanical transducers that translate force or weight into voltage. This change in voltage produces, in the read-out instrumentation, a repeatable deflection or indication that can be calibrated directly in terms of the load applied to the cell. 

An important asset of our load cells is their extremely small deflection. The maximum deflection of standard cells does not exceed .012"" at full load. This plus the fact More... that these load cells contain no moving parts, opens unlimited application fields. The inherent compactness of the cells minimizes installation problems. 

 The frequency response characteristics of our load cells are exceptionally good. The relatively low mass, and the small deflection under load, result in a high frequency response which emphasizes use of the cells in many services where other transducers cannot perform.

Our areas of expertise include optical encoders for the precise measurement of position or speed; digital readout systems for retrofitting machine tools; generation and replication of precise patterns on glass and similar substrates; physical properties test instruments for medical tubing, paper, films, textiles, and other sheet goods; mechanical components; and open-channel flow meters to measure water velocity. 

We received ISO-9001 certification in January, 1996.

We offer Optical Encoders for both rotary and linear motion, in conventional incremental and absolute configurations and in GPIs unique Virtual Absolute technology. They are used to measure or control position and/or speed in medical instrumentation, electronic manufacturing equipment, robotics, factory automation, graphic arts and printing equipment, machine tools, radar pedestals, and high More... speed scanners.

 Our self-contained rotary incremental encoders are available in a variety of sizes, from 0.75"" dia with up to 40,960 counts/rev, to a 6"" dia model with 3,600,000 counts/rev. An industrial-grade rotary absolute encoder offer resolution up to 217 words/rev.

Microprocessor Systems For Data Acquisition, Measurement Of Torque, RPM, Power, Energy, Temperature, Force, Flow Pressure, Weight Displacement, Time Velocity, Volts, AMPS, Watts, Frequency, Efficiency, Counting, Classification","S. Himmelstein and Company is a U.S. manufacturer of torque sensors and signal conditioners. Focused solely on torque since 1960, Himmelstein boasts an expansive product line and a highly accurate knowledge base. Located in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, Himmelstein continues to enhance and improve our torque sensors to provide the best torque measurement solutions.

The Himmelstein Advantage

Best real-world accuracy of any torquemeter, torque sensor, or torque transducer.

S. Himmelstein and Company has been designing and manufacturing the world's best torque measurement transducers and instrumentation since 1960. Our products offer significant advantages over competitive models, enhancing their overall performance under real-world conditions, not just in the calibration stand.

Highest available mechanical overloads:

Select from 200 percent, 400 percent, 500 percent and 1,000 percent overload models. The flexibility to select sensor mechanical overload allows optimal sizing of the sensor to More... suit the application, even in the presence of peak torques that exceed the average running torque. This ensures the best measurement accuracy for the application. For assistance is sizing/selecting the proper torque sensor, please refer to our bulletin entitled Choosing the Correct Torque Transducer.

 High Electrical Overrange:

 All Himmelstein torque transducers and instruments with high-level DC analog output voltages have significant electrical overrange (130 percent to 300 percent depending on model). All rotating mechanical systems have oscillatory signals. When operating at or near full scale, insufficient overrange on the output signal will cause clipping of the peak values and result in an incorrect display of the average torque. By offering significant electrical overrange, Himmelstein transducers provide accurate measurement, even beyond full scale. 

 Himmelstein bearingless torque flanges are the best choice for dynamic measurement and control. That's because the world's highest torsional stiffness yields wider installed bandwidth and faster installed response than any competitive device. Our flanges also feature the industry's highest overrange and greatest isolation from clamping and other extraneous loads. Those features reduce errors from clipped torque peaks and parasitic loads. 

 Superior temperature compensation results in sensor temperature performance that greatly reduces errors caused by drive heating and thermal gradients. This level of temperature performance allows S. Himmelstein and Company to offer dual-range torque transducers with high accuracy.
