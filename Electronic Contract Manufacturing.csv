We serve many and, as a result, create solutions for a wide range of applications.

Beginning as the developer of highly reliable and cost-effective freeze valves for the railroad industry in 1983, ThermOmegaTech now provides the standard in freeze protection valves for the industry and takes pride in protecting billions of dollars of equipment annually.

In addition to solutions for the railroad industry, ThermOmegaTech's thermostatic valve and thermal actuator technology are used in Commercial Plumbing, Aerospace & Defense, and Industrial applications where temperature control is critical.

These applications include freeze protection, scald protection, steam traps, steam tracing, thermal relief, mixing & diverting, cooling fluid control, thermal bypass, thermal balancing, drain tempering, tepid water delivery, and many other applications where ambient, fluid, More... or surface temperatures affect a system.

 Our mixing valves designed for hot/cold water and steam/water applications have been incorporated into Washdown Stations for industrial cleaning, Instantaneous Hot Water Heaters, and Tepid Water Delivery Systems for safety showers and combination face/eyewash stations.

 In 2018, we expanded into the Electronics Contract Manufacturing market by acquiring a local PCB contract manufacturer, IMET Electronics Corporation. Then in 2019, we acquired a second manufacturer, TJM Electronics, and recently merged both brands into ThermOmegaTech.

 Over the past four years, we have invested many resources into our Electronics Division to learn about the industry and our customers from the 30+ years of PCBA experience our employees have had. We moved all employees and equipment into our manufacturing facility in Warminster, PA, located about an hour outside Philadelphia, so all company divisions operate from the same location, which has helped us streamline processes and improve communication channels.

 By combining ThermOmegaTech's expertise in phase-change technology, thermal actuator design, and valve manufacturing with our newly acquired printed circuit board assembly skills, we have broadened our offering to better support our customers' needs.

 Quality Control is our Top Priority

 Our entire team is dedicated to Lean Manufacturing Initiatives and striving to cultivate a culture of continuous improvement, evidenced by having our Quality Management System (QMS) certified ISO 9001 for over 2 decades and elevating that to reach AS9100D Certification since 2019.

From its humble beginnings in an old milk factory in Madisonville, Ohio; the family business grew thanks to the sheer hard work, customer-focus, and business-growth over personal-profit mentality. After just a few years the business out-grew this factory and they were forced to relocate to a much larger site in Cincinnati, Ohio.

The paint was barely dry on the new facility before word spread about their unmatched quality and craftsmanship, quick turn-around times, and fair pricing. Before long the Vogt family found themselves flooded with work but yet again out of space. This time they vowed to pick a site that could grow with the needs of their customers.

Now situated on 20-acres in Amelia, More... Ohio - a small suburb of Cincinnati - Tri-State Fabricators has created one of the most state-of-the-art metal fabrication and finishing facilities in the region. With 125,000 square-feet under one roof, it is home to some of the latest metal fabrication technology and finishing equipment on the market. More importantly, however, it is the team of highly dedicated and skilled men and women that make this company a success.

 While much has changed in the business and market over its long history, Tri-State Fabricators remains faithful in preserving the core values that have supported its customers and grown the business so successfully all these years.

ITAR registered.","Engineers and designers in many industries rely on the accuracy, precision and consistency of photo etched precision metal components. Customers in many industries rely on Conard Corporation to provide the quality, service and value that their photo etching applications demand.

As an AS9100C/ISO9001 and ITAR registered small business enterprise, Conard has long-established relationships with leading enterprise-level customers. We are fully cognizant and capable of meeting the most exacting requirements.

Specializing in photochemical manufacturing, Conard employs both photo etching and nickel electroforming processes to deliver precision solutions for increasingly demanding leading technologies.

Nickel electroforming, an additive manufacturing process, can produce parts as thin as .0003"" with features less than .001"".

Conard produces precisely shaped metal parts, components, and sub-assemblies for the aerospace, computer, electronic, medical, optical, and other industries for technology-driven More... OEM's.

 Photo etching versatility allows the fabrication of parts as small as .020"" diameter or up to 24""x60"". The process is effective for an extensive array of metal alloys, including stainless, carbon and silicon steels, nickel, nickel-iron and nickel-iron-cobalt alloys, copper, brass, bronze, aluminum, molybdenum, and silver. Material thickness ranges from .001"" to .040"" in ferrous, .065"" in copper and up to .080"" in aluminum.

 Photo etching is also the go-to process for fabricating power electronic devices on direct bond copper on ceramic substrates. Medical, industrial and veterinary MRI equipment utilize photo etching to produce copper field and litz magnetic coils. PEM fuel cells in a range of architectures rely on photo etching for stack and cell elements. The range of applications in RF, microwave, and wireless technologies is nearly endless and changing daily. Even comparatively pedestrian industrial applications for shims, gaskets, spacers, retainers, and shields find economical precision solutions in photochemical etching.

 Both chemical etching and electroforming are finding growing applications as technologies are demanding greater power and performance in smaller and smaller packages. The level of complexity and detail that can be achieved with photochemical manufacturing is unmatched by more conventional fabricating processes.

Welding operations include CNC, free hand, robotic and vacuum. Prototype and low to high volume production offered. Suitable for dissimilar metals, seam welded tubes, sensors, small parts and transducers. Serves the aerospace, defense, medical, commercial, cryogenic, dental, electrical, food processing, marine, nuclear, petrochemical, semiconductor, transportation and telecommunications industries. Meets AWS and AMS standards. ITAR registered. NADCAP certified.","Electron Beam Welding is a reliable and cost-effective method of joining a wide range of metals. From pacemakers used in the medical industry to sensors used on fighter aircraft, Electron Beam applications are almost limitless. The welding is performed in a vacuum, therefore welds are clean and free from oxidation. 

Due to the extreme density and precise control of the electrons, high weld ""depth to width"" ratios can be achieved, up to 20-1 is obtainable. With minimal or no distortion, Electron Beam Welding is often the final step of a production sequence. 

Electron Beam welding can offer advantages such as low heat input, minimal heat affected zone and no part distortion. These attributes make it ideal for the welding of intricate final assembly products or sensors that have delicate instrumentation close to the weld joint. Precise control of the electron beam, high speed and repeatability often makes Electron Beam Welding the only viable solution to a difficult manufacturing problem. More... The comparison of an EB weld versus conventional TIG weld illustrates how it can reduce or eliminate distortion and the need for secondary operations. Electron Beam Welding can also save money by reducing joint preparation costs and repeatable settings reduce the risk of operator error.

Riker with the design and subsequent patent of a heavy-duty guillotine style exhaust clamp used in the heavy-duty truck and off-road equipment markets. The guillotine style clamp has been a great success and is still recognized worldwide for its quality and value. 

The success of the guillotine style clamp and Clamps, Inc. didn't happen by chance. Years of dedicated effort by the Riker family and the employees of Clamps, Inc. past and present, have made the company a world leader in the heavy-duty exhaust clamp marketplace. In 1991, the direction of the company changed and new goals were set with a structured plan for the long term growth of the company. The plan with a goal to diversify the company, products and services offered was initiated. While this challenge has been an on-going effort at Clamps, Inc., the many successes achieved to date have been monumental. 

Paramount among these successes has been in the area of our More... commitment to our quality systems program. Our program has been instituted to help insure to our customers they will receive quality products each and every time they receive a shipment. In February of 1999, Clamps, Inc., through a third-party audit from CRS Registrars, Inc., achieved certification to the standards set forth in ISO 9002. As of October 2003, Clamps Incorporated has successfully achieved ANSI/ISO/ASQ Q9001-2000 certification. With this certification along with the subsequent required surveillance audits conducted by CRS, we feel we can assure our customers that the quality systems in use in our quality program will stay on the leading edge.

 Today, Clamps, Inc. is a recognized leader in the exhaust clamp marketplace offering our customers a complete line of exhaust clamp products, U-bolt clamps, band style clamps and hangers.

We know metal and how to work with it - forming, drawing, extruding, etc. We employ a broad spectrum of alloys, and are capable of producing a wide variety of shapes and sizes.

We deliver only ""firsts"". The last product we make is as precise as the first and each in between.

Amdek specializes in engineered product design, tooling and high-precision injection molding coupled with a full range of secondary assembly and decorating processes.

Amdek, Inc. originated in 1991 by Robert Tetzlaff, the son of a naturalized citizen Roger W. Tetzlaff, who immigrated to the United States in 1949 as an indentured servant. Robert was trained in the ""old world school"", meaning if you ran or sold a machine, you learned how to build one. He went to Germany for 10 months as an apprentice at Battenfeld GMBH to learn all aspects of building a molding machine.

Robert started on the ground floor of pad printing as an independent sales representative in the early 1980s when ITW Trans Tech came to the United States. This position allowed him the privilege of working with and learning from hundreds of companies and a vast array of manufacturing, More... quality and large-scale production processes. The 30+ years of experience, knowledge and practice has enabled Amdek to offer unique solutions for the most difficult of projects.

 More recently, Amdek Inc. purchased Dave Shepard Enterprises in Hillsboro, OR. We are headquartered in Somerville, AL, with additional decorating facilities in Baileyton, AL and Newberg, Oregon.

Custom manufacturer of precision deep drawn components including eyelets, enclosures, housings and stampings. Stainless steel, aluminum, beryllium copper, brass, bronze, copper, Inconel®, Invar®, Monel®, Kovar®, nickel, platinum, phosphor bronze, silver and titanium materials used. Capabilities include deep drawn stamping, reverse engineering, designing and rapid prototyping. Additional services such as wire EDM, cladding, annealing, stress relieving, plating, heat treating, packaging and labeling provided. Prototype and low to high volume production offered. Suitable for arthroscopic surgery, fuse cap, solenoid, pen tip, rivet, temperature sensor and other applications. Serves the medical, aerospace, automotive, electronics, pharmaceutical, semiconductor and telecommunications industries. Six Sigma certified. JIT and Kanban delivery.","For more than 40 years, Braxton Manufacturing Co., Inc. has been supplying deep drawn components to the medical, communications, aerospace, specialty automotive and electronics industries. We are an ISO 9001:2008 certified manufacturer of precision deep-drawn eyelets, deep-drawn metal enclosures and housings. We consistently meet the requirements of the most challenging applications in terms of size, tolerance and finishing.

Braxton's proprietary drawing machines and our precision deep drawing process can provide our customers with enhanced product efficiencies and cost savings over traditional manufacturing methods. We build our drawing machines in-house, and they enable us to produce parts in more sizes, and with significantly superior tolerances and finishes, compared to competing processes. We can deep draw parts to 0.0085"" (0.215mm) OD, with wall thicknesses as low as 0.0005"" (0.013mm). Maximum length is 2.250"" (57.15mm), and length-to-diameter ratios as high as 57:1 are attainable. More... Finished part tolerances are as low as +/- 0.0001"" (0.00254mm), with surface finishes to 8 microinches RMS.

 The deep drawing techniques utilized by Braxton offer many benefits, including the assurance of superior part-to-part and batch-to-batch repeatability. Because we start with flat stock and end with a tubular part, material waste is minimized. Also, raw material is work hardened during the drawing process, eliminating the need for secondary heat treating on most finished parts.

 Another advantage of Braxton's deep-drawing process is that starting stock can be clad or pre-plated with gold prior to deep drawing, guaranteeing even coverage of gold on both the OD and ID of microminiature tubes with or without a closed end. This also eliminates the chance of residual acid being trapped in the parts.

 Braxton has a variety of capabilities that maximize the efficiency of producing intricate components. Multiple diameters, knurling, slotting, tabs, shaped flanges, bead diameters, crimp forming, side holes, tapers and shaped piercing are all part of our services. We are experienced in drawing a comprehensive range of conventional and special materials, from aluminum, brass and stainless steel to gold, silver and platinum, and many others. 

 Quality is an essential aspect of Braxton's manufacturing operation. In addition to building our own drawing machines and maintaining in-house die making facilities, we use precision inspection equipment that assists us in the measurement of all dimensional requirements and enables us to work to extremely tight tolerances. Furthermore, the members of our quality assurance staff have an average of over 20 years of experience and are highly trained in the technical aspects of inspection and testing.

Global operations and distribution centers in The Netherlands, Tokyo, Singapore, Sydney, and Silicon Valley (HQ).","For over 25 years, Extron has partnered with its clients to provide cutting-edge supply chain solutions designed to improve flexibility, reduce cost, and reduce risk. We specialize in the emerging field of last-mile manufacturing, plus order fulfillment solutions, returns-management solutions, and demo-loaner solutions.

Last mile manufacturing solutions allow manufacturers to postpone the installation and integration of critical, IP-sensitive, or volume-sensitive components until late in the supply chain - thus improving flexibility and adaptability to demand, reducing IP risk to overseas theft, reducing inventory and operations costs, and improving speed to market.

Global order fulfillment solutions can be coupled with last mile manufacturing solutions, where key integration and configuration steps can be performed immediately before the fulfillment stage.

Returns management solutions allow a company to maximize the value of returned product quickly, by refurbishing it and getting it back More... into inventory ""like new"" often within 24 hours.

 Demo-loaner solutions enhance a company's sales strategy by allowing a ""try before you buy"" option. Running these complex, logistics-intensive programs is difficult - but Extron makes it easy.

Industries served include aerospace, military, motorsports, commercial, electronics, marine & medical.","Fiber Dynamics, Inc. CEO and owner, Darrin Teeter, served as a research associate and composites lab manager for the National Institute for Aviation Research (N.I.A.R.). It was there that Teeter recognized a market need for the production of composite parts with greater manufacturability. In 1991, Mr. Teeter decided to capitalize on the advantages of Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) and opened the doors of Fiber Dynamics. Some of the company's early programs included kit plane components and production of high-volume, high-performance bicycle components such as wheels, frames and swing arms. The business then grew into aircraft interior components which led to dramatic business growth in advanced composite components for the general aviation industry. While their general aviation business was growing, Fiber Dynamics continued to develop and refine new, proprietary materials and processes that enabled Fiber Dynamics to design and fabricate complex hollow-cavity components that before would have More... been impossible to produce with conventional methods. These capabilities and their affordable cost led to the company's growth in the unmanned aerial vehicle market (UAV). Fiber Dynamics' business has grown to include aerospace (general aviation and unmanned vehicles), military, consumer, medical and motorsports. The company is located in Wichita, Kansas. In 2006, Fiber Dynamics expanded into a new, modern 35,000 square foot facility which can easily be expanded to 100,000 square feet. 

 Today Fiber Dynamics, Inc. is a leader in the design and fabrication of simple to complex out-of autoclave composites. Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) is our core technology and expertise. We have built our business on solving seemingly impossible customer problems. Our approach is to develop a thorough understanding of each customer's unique needs and then apply our technical expertise to offer the customer an innovative, comprehensive solution. This approach frequently results in Fiber Dynamics' ability to solve problems that others thought to be impossible. In recent years we have seen an increased need for our ""One-Shot"" integrated structure solutions, which offer customers increased performance often at a lower total cost to the customer.

Also manufacture planetary reduction drive units, used for precise zero-backlash fine-tuning of capacitors and other rotary-tuned devices and positioning systems. All products designed, manufactured, and tested with state-of-the-art technologies in climate-controlled ISO9001 registered facility in the US, and sold worldwide, directly to OEMs, through distributors, and via online shop. All major components manufactured in-house, so customization is readily available. Design assistance, drawings, and 3D models available. Other divisions include flexible and rigid shaft couplings, and production CNC machining to customer specifications.","At first glance, Oren Elliott Products Machining appears to be a very modern company, with sophisticated state-of-the art equipment and metalworking techniques. Beneath the surface, however, lies a long tradition of precision machining in production quantities. We've been machining at our Plant I facility since 1925, when we produced screw-machined subcomponents for electromechanical assemblies under the name American Steel Packaging. At the height of production during World War II, American Steel Packaging (later to become All Star Products) produced millions of screw machine parts for the allied war effort.						

Since Oren Elliott purchased the company in 1983, we've expanded by adding a second plant and several pieces of capital equipment. Most of our new equipment has focused on computer numerically controlled (CNC) machining, with which we serve customers as close as 10 miles away and as far away as California and Maine, in such industries as automotive manufacturing, food processing More... equipment, robotics, semiconductor fabrication equipment, fluid power, and medical/orthopedic equipment, to name a few.						

 The most fundamental aspect of our corporate culture is an emphasis on customer service in the three areas most crucial to companies outsourcing machine work: quality, delivery, and price. Conformance to our customers' quality requirements is ensured by an enterprise-wide quality system based on the ISO9001:2008 standard. Rapid lead-time and on-time delivery result from accurate scheduling and the capacity for high throughput. Competitive pricing is achieved in two ways: first, our overall efficiency results in a low hourly shop rate: and second, our use of innovative, cutting-edge machining techniques results in shorter cycle times and fewer secondary operations (some examples of these techniques are illustrated in our case studies).						

 We pride ourselves on long-standing relationships with many of our customers, some of whom we've been able to provide design assistance (particularly in the area of manufacturability and cost reduction), JIT delivery, prototype and experimental parts, expedited deliveries when necessary, specific quality documentation or procedures (including PPAPs, SPC charts, material traceability, and so on), and turnkey manufacturing services.

RoHS and REACH compliant.","About B. G. Peck Co., Inc.

Every part shipped by B.G. Peck is precisely tooled to meet the specific needs of the customer. Often, that level of precision involves consultation with the specifying design engineers. In fact, it's common for us to recommend different solutions; a more suitable material, for example, or a minor shift in blueprint specifications or tolerances.

We are also alert to cost-savings alternatives. Using a different material might yield equivalent results at a lower cost; a small change in configuration might save on materials, or a materials upgrade might enhance durability and reliability. Quite often, we've recommended consolidating parts production between two or more divisions within the same company - an innovative method for reducing costs which individual specifications might never have identified.

At B.G. Peck we bring a spirit of cooperation to our customer service. Anyone can take an order; we work as a team with our customers to get each part right the first More... time, and the next time, and the next time. That's how B.G. Peck has built so many long-standing business relationships.

 For a company our size, B.G. Peck has a remarkably sophisticated manufacturing plant. Our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities ensure high precision, production speed and materials economy. These operations are supported by a powerful computer system, which allows instantaneous access to customer information. Responding to an incoming order, we can frequently report on materials availability, price and delivery date over the phone; ever quotations can often be handled immediately. What this means to our customer is a speedy disposition of requisitions - one less item requiring a follow-up.

 Our production facility, privately owned and operated, encompasses 50,000 square feet of manufacturing and warehouse space. This allows us to maintain an impressive inventory of materials, and to offer our customers the opportunity for Just-In-Time inventory management. We encourage our customers to issue blanket orders, taking advantage of as-needed delivery and volume pricing and have established ship-to-stock status with several customers. This approach is also made possible by B.G. Peck's superb relationship with our material suppliers, who work with us in the same flexible ""vendor partnering"" arrangement.

 Throughout many diverse industries, B.G. Peck enjoys an unsurpassed reputation for its high standards of precision and quality, which meet the ISO 9001 quality standards. Less",,$5 - 9.9 Mil,10-49  Employees,"Contract Manufacturing: Electronic

"CJ Component Products, LLC",877-345-8161,http://www.cjcomponents.com,"Oakdale, NY 11769",Manufacturer,"ISO 9001:2000 certified manufacturer of military equipment & supplies. Products include antennas, handsets, headsets, loudspeakers, panels, microphones, field telephones, helmets, cable assemblies, wires, communication consoles, switches, radio sets, masts, markers, helicopter parts & accessories, locomotive parts, telephone generators, controls & cords. Communication systems, digital audio systems & encryption systems are available. Contract manufacturing services are available for automotive & electromechanical assemblies & plastic molds. Capabilities include injection molding & co-development & production. Products are suitable for military applications.","CJ has years of experience in the manufacturing and logistical service of military electronics and communication equipment. After producing the components for the AN/VIC-1 vehicle intercom system in the 1980s, it seemed like a normal progression to supply the cabling and audio products associated with military vehicular communication systems. Today, we have complete product lines of handsets, headsets, microphones and speakers, as well as cable assemblies and cabling products and our original product line of communication systems that made us the quality company we are today.

CJ maintains production facilities just outside of Ft. Wayne, Indiana, while having offices just east of New York City. We maintain co-operation agreements with our tool and die /injection molding partners in Ft. Wayne. Most of the support or sub-contract facilities used by CJ are located within driving distance of our production facility or offices. This gives us the ability to take care of our own tooling for the More... components we manufacture. We also maintain extensive inventories on the systems we support. All of this enables us to perform at a high level of productivity and on-time performance.

 CJ supports the standard range of tactical audio components. Our specialty, however, comes in the form of engineering our product line to meet your specification needs for your radio system. Products are upgraded, new technologies are added and new products are developed. Examples of this are our newest line of handsets with crypto capability as well as a complete range of handsets and headsets with electret microphones. CJ has a state-of-the-art modern production facility for our audio products. The microphone and earphone elements as well as the PTT switch assemblies are completely manufactured in-house. Latest audio end electrical test equipment is used and each product on average is tested up to four times during assembly. Services not done in-house, such as tool & die and injection molding, are performed locally with partners. All this gives us the ability to control the quality standards we strive for and the on-time delivery the customer demands. In March of 2001, CJ Components completed setting up its quality control systems and procedures to meet the specifications of ISO9001/2000. In June of 2001, we were audited and became a certified and registered ISO 9001/2000 firm. Less",,$1 - 4.9 Mil,10-49  Employees,"Contract Manufacturing: Electronic
