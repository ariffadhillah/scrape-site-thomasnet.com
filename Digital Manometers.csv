Products include differential pressure gauges, liquid & gas flowmeters, indicators & liquid level monitors. Switches, relays & transmitters are also available. Applications include oil refining, chemical & semiconductor. Kan Ban & JIT delivery.","Orange Research is a manufacturer of industrial instrumentation, supplying differential pressure, flow and level instruments in the form of gauges, switches and transmitters. Some of the many applications for these products are filtration, compressors and heat exchangers for a wide variety of industries including petroleum, chemicals and semiconductors, just to name a few! 

The company's beginnings are rooted in the entrepreneurial spirit of its founder, Les Hoffman, an engineer, who in the early 1960s began working on an indicator to compare differing pressures. Les' enthusiastic, high energy approach led him to develop the first ""Filter Fink"", an indicator that would tell the user when the filter needed to be cleaned or replaced.

From this early success, the company grew to offer a wide array of differential pressure gauges and switches, adding features as customers requested them. Flow instruments and transmitters followed along with level switches. Over time it seemed that Orange Research More... products were being used anywhere there was flow or storage of a liquid or gas. 

 Today, known worldwide as a supplier of rugged, reliable instruments, Orange Research continues to be responsive to customer requests while designing instruments for the next generation of users. As always, custom instruments in a quantity of one are welcome.

 Customers have always come first at OR. With worldwide distribution and a staff of qualified support personnel, answers are only a phone call or e-mail away. Through continuous improvement and cost-effective manufacturing methods, Orange Research remains committed to keeping prices low while maintaining exceptionally high quality and service.

Products include silicon based pressure sensors, pressure sensor systems & manometers. Products range from 1/2 in. water full scale to 100 psi. Industries served include pneumatic controls, medical, environmental & HVAC instrumentation.  RoHS compliant products available on request.","All Sensors Corporation is a leading manufacturer of MEMS piezoresitive pressure sensors and pressure transducers. Our company goal is to manufacture high-accuracy, quality pressure sensors that provide customers with the ideal sensor solution. All Sensors¬í team is comprised of highly talented and experienced individuals who strive to provide our customers with excellent technical information and customer service. Our pressure sensors are specially designed for low-pressure measurement, high accuracy and repeatability. Core competencies such as low pressure, high accuracy and innovative technologies have made All Sensors a reliable sensor supplier for many large OEMs. 

Applications for our sensors are vast. Our pressure sensors perform well in a low pressure, high accuracy environments. A few examples of common applications include ventilators, transport ventilators, sleep apnea, oxygen delivery, drug delivery, portable oxygen therapy, lung spirometry, blood pressure monitoring, hospital More... beds, and electrocardiograms, HVAC monitoring devices, building monitoring systems, environmental monitoring devices, remote sensing, industrial automation, air sampling, air speed, and leak detection. Many of these applications require a low pressure measurement and high accuracy output signal.

 All Sensors manufactures four different types of pressure sensors, basic output (uncompensated sensor), mV output (compensated sensor), amplified output, and digital output. Our basic pressure sensor provides an uncompensated and non-calibrated mV output signal. This device offers a raw output signal and does not compensate for error, such as temperature effects. Basic pressure sensors offer OEMs a low cost sensor that meets the requirements of their application. Secondly, we offer a compensated and calibrated mV output pressure sensor. These sensors are compensated for temperature and calibrated for offset and span. Third, All Sensors manufactures amplified pressure sensors. These sensors or transducers offer a calibrated and compensated output signal that is amplified for the OEM. Lastly All Sensors offers a digital output pressure sensor. These devices are extremely accurate and provide complete digital compensation. Temperature compensated pressure sensors are available in three temperature ranges, commercial (5‚Å∞C to 50(70)‚Å∞C), industrial (-25‚Å∞C to 85‚Å∞C), and military (-40‚Å∞C to 125‚Å∞C). Pressure ranges are available as low as ¬º inH2O and as high as 150PSI.

 All Sensors¬í pressure sensors and transducers are available in several PCB mountable packages with options to fit your application. Custom port fittings and package options are available as well as customizable pressure ranges and performance values. Our team provides engineering assistance to help integrate pressure sensors into your specific application.

Customer Focus

Johnstone Supply dedicates itself to providing the highest quality products and service to our customers. To ensure we can meet the challenges of a dynamic industry, our company quickly develops and adapts programs to fulfill customer needs on a national and regional scale, while our individual stores customize these programs for their local markets.

The Johnstone Supply Catalog

Ever-growing product depth and quality plus ongoing improvements to the Johnstone Supply Catalog guarantee its continued status as the best source in the HVACR industry for parts, supplies and equipment. Available both in print and online with detailed illustrations and specifications, the online catalog features more than 50,000 quality products from the top manufacturers in the business, with more added every day.

Industry Expertise

Johnstone Supply views education as an essential, powerful tool that gives our stores and their valued customers a distinct competitive advantage. More... Our Johnstone University program offers intensive technical and business seminars to store owners and personnel, ensuring we have the most experienced, knowledgeable and helpful counter staff in the industry. To make continuing education even more effective we have developed Internet courseware to bring product training and expertise to the staff at our stores anywhere in the country, accessible round the clock.

 For our contractor and technician customers, Johnstone stores offer numerous educational opportunities to help propel them to the forefront of their profession, including onsite, hands-on technical training classes and NATE certification both in-store and online.

 Unmatched Supplier Relationships

 The HVACR industry is in a period of tremendous change. Consolidation has become the norm rather than the exception, and small, privately owned businesses are quickly disappearing. The Johnstone Supply Cooperative is uniquely equipped to meet this challenge in ways that are beneficial to our customers. We pride ourselves on having close, mutually beneficial relationships with the top manufacturers around the country, making sure our customers have access to the best products at competitive prices at every Johnstone store.
