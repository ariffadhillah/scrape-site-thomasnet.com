"Lutz Pumps, Inc.",800-843-3901,https://www.lutzpumps.com/,"Norcross, GA 30093",Manufacturer,"Manufacturer of drum & container pumps including air operated pumps & electric & air operated double diaphragm pumps.

Also available are accessories including nozzles, flow meters, hoses, couplings, fume barriers, quick connect couplings, reducers, discharge spouts, bonding & grounding wires & side mount clamps.","Karl Lutz founded his drum pump manufacturing company in 1954. What started as a purely practically motivated concern with the basic idea of ""How can I get a liquid out of a drum as efficient and safe as possible?"" became the ""task of a lifetime"" -- not only for Karl Lutz, but for the field of drum pump technology as a whole. 

Lutz drum and container pumps contribute today towards rendering life and future working conditions even safer, in a world environment which is becoming ever conscious to be better protected.

Some people call it corporate philosophy -- we would just like to say what we do: we provide safe solutions specially for pumping fluids. Responsibility for efficient and yet safe working conditions, for health and the environment, is for us not a question of a quick solution, but an obligation for us.

Lutz has concentrated its efforts on the narrow but specialist field of ""drum and container pumps."" Since we are the best in this field, we are also able to be of greater benefit More... to our customers, our users and the environment. By problem analysis Lutz has brought innovative technology to drum pumps. What is important is that: the final solution is safe, effective and long-lasting.

 Those products that have a bright future in store are those which are oriented towards individual requirements. The wide variety of tasks, liquids and container dimensions has determined the spread of the Lutz range. Less",,$1 - 4.9 Mil,1-9  Employees,"Flowmeters: Electronic

In 1942, Ted Quarnstrom began Detroit Mold Engineering (later to become D-M-E Company) to provide mold bases in standard sizes, ready for machining of the cavity. This innovation empowered the skilled moldmaker to practice his craft more efficiently and the concept of the standard mold base was born. 

D-M-E is focused on one thing -- to help make moldmakers, molders and mold designers produce better parts. Every D-M-E product cuts costs, reduces time-to-market or improves the finished molded product (sometimes all three). Today, the D-M-E product line encompasses a wide range of products, including: mold bases  D-M-E standard, custom-machined and MoldBasics series, plus Master Unit Die (MUD) quick change, mold systems and components, mold components  ejector pins and sleeves, leader and core pins, mold action devices, mold cooling, interlocks, lifters and other components, 

Moldmaking equipment and supplies More...  cutting tools, polishing and finishing equipment and repair welders, hot runner systems and components  from turnkey hot halves to individual components, mold control systems  solutions for hot runner temperature and other electronic control applications, and technical services  application engineering, field service and product support.
