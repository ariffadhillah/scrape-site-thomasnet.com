D-M-E is focused on one thing -- to help make moldmakers, molders and mold designers produce better parts. Every D-M-E product cuts costs, reduces time-to-market or improves the finished molded product (sometimes all three). Today, the D-M-E product line encompasses a wide range of products, including: mold bases  D-M-E standard, custom-machined and MoldBasics series, plus Master Unit Die (MUD) quick change, mold systems and components, mold components  ejector pins and sleeves, leader and core pins, mold action devices, mold cooling, interlocks, lifters and other components, 

Moldmaking equipment and supplies More...  cutting tools, polishing and finishing equipment and repair welders, hot runner systems and components  from turnkey hot halves to individual components, mold control systems  solutions for hot runner temperature and other electronic control applications, and technical services  application engineering, field service and product support.
