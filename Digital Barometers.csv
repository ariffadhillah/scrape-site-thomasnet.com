Kestrel Instruments,800-784-4221,https://kestrelinstruments.com/,"Boothwyn, PA 19061",Manufacturer,"Manufacturer of environmental measuring devices, including weather meters, data loggers, heat stress monitors, and trackers. Select products can measure up to 20 different meteorological parameters, including temperature, wind speed, fire, agricultural, and racing weather, heat index, dew point, pressure, altitude, and humidity. Products are drop, dust, and waterproof and can withstand harsh-environments. Compatible with smart phones and USB-wired products. Suitable for agricultural, ballistics, firefighting, heat stress management, hunting, fishing, industrial, military, research, outdoor recreation, and meteorological applications.","At Kestrel we've been researching, designing, manufacturing and distributing our weather & environmental meters for more than 20 years. Our team of experts and engineers are determined to make the most accurate and reliable handheld weather devices available. We are continuously dedicated to researching ways to improve the Kestrel line and create new products to meet our customers' needs.

Every single Kestrel Weather & Environmental Meter is calibrated for every single value, either directly against NIST-traceable standards or against an intermediary standard calibrated daily. Every unit is shipped with a FREE Certificate of Conformity that states what calibrations were performed, and the certified performance specifications. What does that mean for you? You can be absolutely sure that your weather readings are accurate to the stated specifications. Some competing weather instruments claim the same specifications as Kestrel, but only Kestrel certifies their accuracy. For an additional charge, More... we can even provide a NIST-traceable Certificate of Calibration that specifies exactly which values were measured in each multi-point calibration, and details the calibrated standard used for testing. Our 30-day satisfaction guarantee covers accuracy concerns as well, so if you question your unit's accuracy after purchase we will double-check every calibration to verify the unit meets specifications.
