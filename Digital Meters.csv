Transducer Techniques, LLC established in 1979, designs and manufactures a complete line of load cells, torque sensors, special purpose transducers and related instrumentation. Transducer Techniques, LLC load cells are uniquely designed for weighing and force measurement in such diversified applications as process control, factory automation plus hundreds of other services in every field of science and industry. All transducer sensing elements incorporate bonded foil strain gages wired in a full wheatstone bridge configuration. 

Load cells are electro-mechanical transducers that translate force or weight into voltage. This change in voltage produces, in the read-out instrumentation, a repeatable deflection or indication that can be calibrated directly in terms of the load applied to the cell. 

An important asset of our load cells is their extremely small deflection. The maximum deflection of standard cells does not exceed .012"" at full load. This plus the fact More... that these load cells contain no moving parts, opens unlimited application fields. The inherent compactness of the cells minimizes installation problems. 

 The frequency response characteristics of our load cells are exceptionally good. The relatively low mass, and the small deflection under load, result in a high frequency response which emphasizes use of the cells in many services where other transducers cannot perform.

Engineering assistance, design assistance and repair services for the fluid transfer systems are available.","Air Flo Spray Equipment specializes in the tough to solve fluid handling problems of industrial as well as consumer markets. Our experience & connections assure you of a timely response & unique solutions based approach to the fluid problem you face. 

A huge problem that we all face is municipal solid waste generation and the landfill. In 2007, Americans threw out about 570 billion pounds of municipal solid waste. Compared to other nations, the United States has a record of generating waste at an alarming rate. Home to only 4% of the global population, we are responsible for more than 30% of the planets total waste generation. Each American discards an average of more than 1,650 pounds of garbage every year, or approximately 4.6 pounds per person each day, nearly double the 1960 average of 2.7 pounds per day. 

Our consumer refill marketing program addresses this with an elegant & technologically advanced automated retail system to deliver products such as shampoos, conditioners, laundry More... soap, hand lotion and other consumer fluid products in a sealed, yet refillable package form that can reduce the solid waste created by consumer packaging for liquids such as squeeze & pump trigger bottles typically found in retail outlets. 

 The technology is called PERFECTFLOW® which combines the functions of a pressure vessel or container with a pump. We call it a pump-tainer. It is the heart of the refill marketing program and has application usage in a wide range of fluid handling needs. Being self-contained and self-powered, plus sealed and refillable, the technology is truly an engineering marvel and delivers value in many forms. It is used in industrial processes such as automotive sound deadening liquid application to railroad lubrication duties in remote locations due to the self-contained/self-powered aspect of the capabilities. The consumer automated retail systems featuring the PERFECTFLOW® technology are poised to disrupt how fluids are delivered to consumers and the future is now!

Custom Design

Each product we design is specifically tailored to your specifications. Our sales engineers work with you every step of the way to make sure that your project turns out the way you want it to. They don't use the ""hard sell"" to force you into something that you don't want. Rather, they draw on years of experience to guide you through the tough choices like:

* Component choice

* Efficiency

* Reliability

* Scalability

* Implementation

So when your ready to let us help you design and implement your next project Contact Us and let's work together to bring your idea to fruition.

End to End Service

Our service technicians don't stop with More... our products. In fact, we pride ourselves on providing our customers with industry leading service that extends well beyond our product lines. If you have an issue in the field our technicians will work with you to pinpoint the issue no matter where it lies. Whether it's in the hydraulic system (e.g. bad coils), engine (e.g. engine fault analysis), or electrical system (e.g. short, overload, open load); We'll work with you until the issue is resolved or a plan of action is in place.

 Repairable Products

 In today's world most products seem to be ""throw away"" by design. Meaning that if it breaks just throw it away and get a new one. Well that's not good enough for us. Our products are completely repairable. Our repair technicians are skilled at repairing all of our products down to the component level. What's more is that we offer 24 hour turn around on repairs. What this means for you is that you can send your product back to us and we'll repair it and ship it back to you within 24 hours. Granted, there are situations where this is not possible (i.e specialized parts that need to be ordered), but, we make every effort to make sure you have your item back quickly so there is minimal down time.

Backwoods Solar Electric Systems,208-263-4290,https://backwoodssolar.com/,"Sandpoint, ID 83864",Distributor,"Manufacturer of monitors and fixtures and distributor of solar electric systems and equipment with a focus in renewable energy. Various other products available include adapters, arresters, barrels, batteries, boxes, bulbs, chargers, clips, connectors, converters, controls, coolers, electric wire, cable and cable assemblies, fans, freezers, fuses, generators, heaters, meters, mounts, ovens, panels and pumps. Custom sizes and most products available in stock.","Backwoods Solar is a company specifically dedicated to serving homes, villages and communities so remote that access to utility lines is not practical. For almost 40 years, we have specialized in independent electric power for the remote off-grid or grid-tied home. We have nine solar electric specialists offering personalized attention to self-reliant home owners who choose and install their own power systems, as well as larger installers doing off-grid battery based and grid-connected solar around the world. 

In the last five years we have expanded our focus to offer remote power for telecom systems, water pumping, clinics and rural villages internationally. What makes us unique is that our technicians live in homes that get their power from the wind, water or sun using the products we sell in our catalog. Our team personally answers all letters, email, and call during business hours, to help with your questions and equipment needs. Your questions will get answered and your needs will More... be met. It is our earnest goal to leave you completely satisfied. 

 Backwoods Solar has been designing off-grid solar, wind, and micro-hydro systems that work without the grid since 1978. Since grid-tie solar systems have become more prevalent, we have used our battery expertise to help design systems that incorporate both the features of utility net metering, with the convenience of battery back-up when outages happen. Back-up power systems do not even have to incorporate solar, since power outages occur most often during times of inclement weather. Many of the standby inverter and battery systems that we design can automatically support a few selected emergency needs during short utility outages. When the utility fails, the system can instantly deliver power to a computer, cash register, pellet stove, or lights for frequent and sometimes longer utility outages. Batteries are kept at fully charged by utility power until an outage, at which time the inverter automatically takes over the selected emergency needs. Additionally, a quiet, durable propane fueled generator set with manual or automatic transfer switch can power the whole house during hours, days, or even weeks of power outage emergency.

 Our experience has taught us that customized systems are better. Power is too important to leave it to a one-size-fits-all product or pre-packaged kit.Let us design a customized system for you. We offer free system design and we'll be there after the sale, too, for the life of the system! Less",www.linkedin.com/company/backwoods-solar,$10 - 24.9 Mil,10-49  Employees,"Meters: Digital
