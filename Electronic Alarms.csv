STI is a family owned and operated business that began over forty years ago with Jack Taylor's invention of the StopperÂ® Pull Station Protector. Safety Technology now markets hundreds of unique products throughout the world to prevent false fire alarms and the theft and vandalism of the things that protect us all, such as smoke detectors, pull stations, horn/strobes, exit signs, and fire extinguishers.

With offices in Waterford, Michigan, Worcestershire, England, and Waterford, Ireland, the STI team has worked hard to continue the work that Jack Taylor started. STI's first product came directly at the request of a customer, Garnett Hegeman: a high school principal in Detroit, Michigan who had a problem with false fire alarms. Most new products throughout the years are a direct result of these types of requests. If you have a false fire alarm, theft, vandalism or other problem, STI invites you to contact them with the challenge of solving it. More...
