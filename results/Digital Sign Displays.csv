Backwoods Solar Electric Systems,208-263-4290,https://backwoodssolar.com/,"Sandpoint, ID 83864",Distributor,"Manufacturer of monitors and fixtures and distributor of solar electric systems and equipment with a focus in renewable energy. Various other products available include adapters, arresters, barrels, batteries, boxes, bulbs, chargers, clips, connectors, converters, controls, coolers, electric wire, cable and cable assemblies, fans, freezers, fuses, generators, heaters, meters, mounts, ovens, panels and pumps. Custom sizes and most products available in stock.","Backwoods Solar is a company specifically dedicated to serving homes, villages and communities so remote that access to utility lines is not practical. For almost 40 years, we have specialized in independent electric power for the remote off-grid or grid-tied home. We have nine solar electric specialists offering personalized attention to self-reliant home owners who choose and install their own power systems, as well as larger installers doing off-grid battery based and grid-connected solar around the world. 

In the last five years we have expanded our focus to offer remote power for telecom systems, water pumping, clinics and rural villages internationally. What makes us unique is that our technicians live in homes that get their power from the wind, water or sun using the products we sell in our catalog. Our team personally answers all letters, email, and call during business hours, to help with your questions and equipment needs. Your questions will get answered and your needs will More... be met. It is our earnest goal to leave you completely satisfied. 

 Backwoods Solar has been designing off-grid solar, wind, and micro-hydro systems that work without the grid since 1978. Since grid-tie solar systems have become more prevalent, we have used our battery expertise to help design systems that incorporate both the features of utility net metering, with the convenience of battery back-up when outages happen. Back-up power systems do not even have to incorporate solar, since power outages occur most often during times of inclement weather. Many of the standby inverter and battery systems that we design can automatically support a few selected emergency needs during short utility outages. When the utility fails, the system can instantly deliver power to a computer, cash register, pellet stove, or lights for frequent and sometimes longer utility outages. Batteries are kept at fully charged by utility power until an outage, at which time the inverter automatically takes over the selected emergency needs. Additionally, a quiet, durable propane fueled generator set with manual or automatic transfer switch can power the whole house during hours, days, or even weeks of power outage emergency.

 Our experience has taught us that customized systems are better. Power is too important to leave it to a one-size-fits-all product or pre-packaged kit.Let us design a customized system for you. We offer free system design and we'll be there after the sale, too, for the life of the system! Less",www.linkedin.com/company/backwoods-solar,$10 - 24.9 Mil,10-49  Employees,"Displays: Digital Sign
