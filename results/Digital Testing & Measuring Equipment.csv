Transducer Techniques, LLC established in 1979, designs and manufactures a complete line of load cells, torque sensors, special purpose transducers and related instrumentation. Transducer Techniques, LLC load cells are uniquely designed for weighing and force measurement in such diversified applications as process control, factory automation plus hundreds of other services in every field of science and industry. All transducer sensing elements incorporate bonded foil strain gages wired in a full wheatstone bridge configuration. 

Load cells are electro-mechanical transducers that translate force or weight into voltage. This change in voltage produces, in the read-out instrumentation, a repeatable deflection or indication that can be calibrated directly in terms of the load applied to the cell. 

An important asset of our load cells is their extremely small deflection. The maximum deflection of standard cells does not exceed .012"" at full load. This plus the fact More... that these load cells contain no moving parts, opens unlimited application fields. The inherent compactness of the cells minimizes installation problems. 

 The frequency response characteristics of our load cells are exceptionally good. The relatively low mass, and the small deflection under load, result in a high frequency response which emphasizes use of the cells in many services where other transducers cannot perform.

Capabilities include calibrating non-contact measuring systems to meet National Physical Laboratory standards. Calibrating services are also available for microscopes.","With 60 years of manufacturing excellence, we have become one of the world's most innovative and dynamic microscope manufacturers. Our products offer superior optics for inspecting and measuring critical components and are used worldwide for accurate inspection and rework.

Specializing in 'eyepiece-less' optical stereo microscopes, digital and 3D digital inspection, and non-contact/contact measurement systems, we hold world patents for ergonomic optical technology and performance. Our products are widely used in electronics, medical devices, plastics, and general manufacturing facilities worldwide.

The main benefits of our renowned Dynascope (eyepiece-less) technology are the reductions in user eye fatigue and neck strain. Unlike traditional microscopes, where the user is in a fixed working position, our patented design expands the exit pupil of the subject and offers the operator freedom of head and body position. This results in a significant reduction of fatigue and strain and helps More... to improve productivity, accuracy and a reduction in costs.

 The Mantis® and Lynx® families of stereo microscopes offer superb optical images and are used throughout the world for a wide range of inspection, preparation and manipulation tasks requiring hand-to-eye co-ordination.

 For users requiring digital microscopy, our EVO Cam is a full HD high-performance digital microscope ideal for quality control, testing, inspection, and documentation. Without the need for a computer, images are easily captured using a USB memory stick or displayed directly to a monitor.

 Our eyepiece-less technology is also a key feature in our optical range of non-contact measurement systems. We offer optical, video, dual technology (optical and video), and automated systems.
