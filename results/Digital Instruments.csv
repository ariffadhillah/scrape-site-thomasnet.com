Transducer Techniques, LLC established in 1979, designs and manufactures a complete line of load cells, torque sensors, special purpose transducers and related instrumentation. Transducer Techniques, LLC load cells are uniquely designed for weighing and force measurement in such diversified applications as process control, factory automation plus hundreds of other services in every field of science and industry. All transducer sensing elements incorporate bonded foil strain gages wired in a full wheatstone bridge configuration. 

Load cells are electro-mechanical transducers that translate force or weight into voltage. This change in voltage produces, in the read-out instrumentation, a repeatable deflection or indication that can be calibrated directly in terms of the load applied to the cell. 

An important asset of our load cells is their extremely small deflection. The maximum deflection of standard cells does not exceed .012"" at full load. This plus the fact More... that these load cells contain no moving parts, opens unlimited application fields. The inherent compactness of the cells minimizes installation problems. 

 The frequency response characteristics of our load cells are exceptionally good. The relatively low mass, and the small deflection under load, result in a high frequency response which emphasizes use of the cells in many services where other transducers cannot perform.

A team of experts in heat transfer developed the SCORPION Data Logging Measurement System with these directives in mind.

The SCORPION idea was first conceived by Fylde Thermal Engineering of Macclesfield, England, back in 1988. At that time a 16 channel data logger and a temperature array was the complete system, with data analysis performed by an early version of MS Excel. Today the SCORPION 2 is a complete hardware/software measurement system, with a 32 input channel data logger and a group of compatible sensors helping process engineers, quality control engineers, and oven manufactures understand the four key parameters in any thermal process: 1) Temperature [Air, Band, and Product Core], 2) Air Velocity, 3) Energy Transfer, and 4) Humidity.

With an eye on customer needs, Reading Thermal developed the SCORPION Profiling Service to help customers More... solve baking, drying, and cooling problems. And to help bring customers in compliance with OSHA regulations the Oven Safety Inspection Program was developed.

Products include the eyepiece-less inspection and non-contact measurement systems, eyepiece-less microscope, and expanded pupil microscopes. Capabilities include calibrating non-contact measuring systems to meet National Physical Laboratory standards. Calibrating services are also available for microscopes.","With 60 years of manufacturing excellence, we have become one of the world's most innovative and dynamic microscope manufacturers. Our products offer superior optics for inspecting and measuring critical components and are used worldwide for accurate inspection and rework.

Specializing in 'eyepiece-less' optical stereo microscopes, digital and 3D digital inspection, and non-contact/contact measurement systems, we hold world patents for ergonomic optical technology and performance. Our products are widely used in electronics, medical devices, plastics, and general manufacturing facilities worldwide.

The main benefits of our renowned Dynascope (eyepiece-less) technology are the reductions in user eye fatigue and neck strain. Unlike traditional microscopes, where the user is in a fixed working position, our patented design expands the exit pupil of the subject and offers the operator freedom of head and body position. This results in a significant reduction of fatigue and strain and helps More... to improve productivity, accuracy and a reduction in costs.

 The Mantis® and Lynx® families of stereo microscopes offer superb optical images and are used throughout the world for a wide range of inspection, preparation and manipulation tasks requiring hand-to-eye co-ordination.

 For users requiring digital microscopy, our EVO Cam is a full HD high-performance digital microscope ideal for quality control, testing, inspection, and documentation. Without the need for a computer, images are easily captured using a USB memory stick or displayed directly to a monitor.

 Our eyepiece-less technology is also a key feature in our optical range of non-contact measurement systems. We offer optical, video, dual technology (optical and video), and automated systems.

Fluke, Extech, Sperry, AEMC, BK Precision, Amprobe & Wavetek Instruments for megohmmeters, ohmmeters, insulation testers, vibrating reed frequency meters, running time meters.","Vibrating Reed Tachometers (STANDCO)

Vibrating reed tachometers require no power source, so they are ideal for hazardous areas. In addition, they can be safely used on all types of enclosed equipment to accurately measure rotation without the need for contact with high speed shafts. They are economical since there are no accessories and they are virtually maintenance free. Instruments are thoroughly gasketed and moisture-proof.

Stationary Tachometers, Hand-Held Tachometers, Dwarf Tachometers

Type R Stationary Vibrating Reed Tachometers - These vibrating reed tachometers are designed for permanent mounting. They are fitted with lugs to suit the mounting brackets shown below. Enclosed in a gasket, splash proof case, these instruments have a white face with black markings. Available with N.I.S.T. certification.

Type H Hand-Held Vibrating Reed Tachometers - These units are designed to be held against the housing of the equipment being checked. They can also be permanently mounted if desired More... with 8400 and 8401 brackets. Carrying cases are available.

 Static Electricity Eliminators

 Magic Wand Static Neutralizer - The Magic Wand is the safe, cost effective way to eliminate the problems of static electricity in the printing industry and in paper, film, plastic, textile and rubber processing applications. Since it uses no complex electrical or mechanical components, the Magic Wand static neutralizer is low in cost and easy to install without changes in existing machinery. There are no maintenance or operating expenses. The absence of high voltage transformers and cables eliminates the possibility of shocks or sparks caused by faulty insulation. In addition, the Magic Wand static electricity eliminators emits no radioactive rays that could possibly cause health problems. Material being processed can not be damaged by the Magic Wand since there are no sharp points. The Magic Wand can be ordered in special lengths to fit your equipment without additional costs.

 Pocket Laser Tachometers

 The Model MT-1B Pocket Laser Tachometer is a compact and highly accurate industrial measuring instrument designed for ease of use and maximum versatility in the plant and field. With MT-1B measures total revolutions (REV), revolutions-per-minute, and length in yards, feet, and meters.

 Hand Tachometers

VEE GEE Scientific was founded by our Chairman, Guy McFarland, in 1981. We are, in essence, an importing wholesaler. We buy alternative brand name product lines in large quantities from overseas and sell worldwide to resellers, primarily laboratory supply companies.

Historically our niche has been supplying the small to medium sized companies who need a price advantage in order to compete. That position has evolved as our product lines have gained recognition as quality brand names preferred in many industries. We continue to supply the small and medium sized distributor, and now find ourselves also supplying some of the largest companies in our field. It is important to note that we hold tightly to a philosophy of importing only products which hold their own in quality comparisons, and which have a stable, long-term future. We could not remain in business if we simply sought the least expensive brands in the world. Without seeming too clichè, our products More... offer the best overall value, not simply the lowest price.

 Our most important asset is our ability to service our customers in a personal yet professional manner. While we are not the largest company in our industry, our commitment to excellence is second to none. Less",,$1 - 4.9 Mil,10-49  Employees,"Instruments: Digital
