"CJ Component Products, LLC",877-345-8161,http://www.cjcomponents.com,"Oakdale, NY 11769",Manufacturer,"ISO 9001:2000 certified manufacturer of military equipment & supplies. Products include antennas, handsets, headsets, loudspeakers, panels, microphones, field telephones, helmets, cable assemblies, wires, communication consoles, switches, radio sets, masts, markers, helicopter parts & accessories, locomotive parts, telephone generators, controls & cords. Communication systems, digital audio systems & encryption systems are available. Contract manufacturing services are available for automotive & electromechanical assemblies & plastic molds. Capabilities include injection molding & co-development & production. Products are suitable for military applications.","CJ has years of experience in the manufacturing and logistical service of military electronics and communication equipment. After producing the components for the AN/VIC-1 vehicle intercom system in the 1980s, it seemed like a normal progression to supply the cabling and audio products associated with military vehicular communication systems. Today, we have complete product lines of handsets, headsets, microphones and speakers, as well as cable assemblies and cabling products and our original product line of communication systems that made us the quality company we are today.

CJ maintains production facilities just outside of Ft. Wayne, Indiana, while having offices just east of New York City. We maintain co-operation agreements with our tool and die /injection molding partners in Ft. Wayne. Most of the support or sub-contract facilities used by CJ are located within driving distance of our production facility or offices. This gives us the ability to take care of our own tooling for the More... components we manufacture. We also maintain extensive inventories on the systems we support. All of this enables us to perform at a high level of productivity and on-time performance.

 CJ supports the standard range of tactical audio components. Our specialty, however, comes in the form of engineering our product line to meet your specification needs for your radio system. Products are upgraded, new technologies are added and new products are developed. Examples of this are our newest line of handsets with crypto capability as well as a complete range of handsets and headsets with electret microphones. CJ has a state-of-the-art modern production facility for our audio products. The microphone and earphone elements as well as the PTT switch assemblies are completely manufactured in-house. Latest audio end electrical test equipment is used and each product on average is tested up to four times during assembly. Services not done in-house, such as tool & die and injection molding, are performed locally with partners. All this gives us the ability to control the quality standards we strive for and the on-time delivery the customer demands. In March of 2001, CJ Components completed setting up its quality control systems and procedures to meet the specifications of ISO9001/2000. In June of 2001, we were audited and became a certified and registered ISO 9001/2000 firm. Less",,$1 - 4.9 Mil,10-49  Employees,"Digital Audio Systems
