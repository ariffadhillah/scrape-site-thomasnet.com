Prototyping & long run production services available.","Our Products and Services have developed and evolved fueled by our desire to meet the needs of our Customers. Now as we are in the midst of our second decade, our products and services fall into the following general categories:

Overhead Conveyor Components and Systems:

1stSource offers quality components for all of the following (8) sub-types of OHC as well as the design/build and systems integration ability for expansions of existing systems and new systems.The first of the two basic types of OHC are known as Enclosed Track Conveyor (ETC). We offer both Round Tube Enclosed Track Conveyors and Square Track Enclosed Track Conveyors. For X Type drop forged Overhead Conveyor (OHC) Chain and components, 1stSource offers competitive pricing for the three types of X Type OHC: X348, X458 and X678

Bearings and Ball Transfers:

1stSource holds inventory of over 150 SKUs of the most commonly used bearings and ball transfers in the conveyor industry for same or next day shipment. In addition we offer More... volume pricing to our OEM Customers based on annual blanket order agreements. We have the ability to design and develop almost any type of bearing and ball transfer required if our Customers have adequate usages to justify development costs and inventory.

 Fence & Gate Hardware:

 1stSource entered the Fence Industry because we were asked to develop a series of Cantilever Gate rollers for a national Fence Hardware Distribution Customer. These components are wheels each with bearings and they were similar to the Conveyor components familiar to us. After supplying these Gate Rollers for several years, our Customer turned over marketing to 1stSource and we entered the Fence market ourselves. We also provide steel hinges and attachments for wood and vinyl fencing, glass-fiber reinforced hinges and latches and a line of glass-filled reinforced hinges.

 Hinges and Industrial Hardware components:

 1stSource holds continual inventory of many steel butt hinges for annual blanket order supply to our OEM Customers. 

 OEM Component development and long term supply:

 Typically, our Customers request that we provide proposals for the development of different types of proprietary components and assemblies. We submit our offers with schedules for design, tooling and develop of prototype samples for Customer inspection, testing and approval. At times prototype samples require modifications, but once samples are approved by Customers we then proceed to https://tnetcc.thomasnet.com/ccnew/mission.html?soannual blanket order agreements, whereby we supply the products just in time from our US warehouse or via direct volume shipments to the Customers facility.

 What type of OEM products can 1stSource develop and supply? Just ask us and we will tell you if we are capable of developing a product or not, but in general we excel at bearing related products, stamped steel assemblies, castings, forgings etc. Less",www.linkedin.com/company/1stsource-products-inc./about/,$1 - 4.9 Mil,10-49  Employees,"Inverters

Therefore, we expanded our product line, with each custom machine geared toward reducing risk and saving valuable time. We made the decision to bring everything back home years ago, realizing the importance of upholding the highest standard of quality, and not contributing to unsafe environmental practices. Our innovative, top-notch risk assessment examines the potential outcomes of each product and subsequently constructs a lasting piece of machinery that aims to reduce risk and improve your productivity.

There comes a time when merely getting a product off the shelf and at the lowest price is just not enough.

At Carlson - Dimond & Wright, Inc. we know our products, and take pride in being able to assist our customers in selecting the product that will best serve their application, now and in the future. All of our efforts are directed toward seeing that our customers get the right product, at the right time, and that it is fully supported after the sale.

Beginning in 1956 as consulting engineers for the automotive industry, Carlson - Dimond & Wright, Inc.s first contract was for the design of body storage lines for the Chevrolet Plant at Janesville, More... Wisconsin. From this we grew to be a pre-eminent power transmission distributor in eastern Michigan. Our ability to service our product line after the sale is unsurpassed in our market. We are capable of repairing all of our mechanical products on. Carlson - Dimond & Wright, Inc.s service department provides field start-up assistance with our own staff.

This attention to detail applies to the simplest coupling or bearing, as well as to the more sophisticated, highly technical drives. We are always looking for new and better ways to solve your manufacturing problems. We care about what we do and how we do it!

Backwoods Solar Electric Systems,208-263-4290,https://backwoodssolar.com/,"Sandpoint, ID 83864",Distributor,"Manufacturer of monitors and fixtures and distributor of solar electric systems and equipment with a focus in renewable energy. Various other products available include adapters, arresters, barrels, batteries, boxes, bulbs, chargers, clips, connectors, converters, controls, coolers, electric wire, cable and cable assemblies, fans, freezers, fuses, generators, heaters, meters, mounts, ovens, panels and pumps. Custom sizes and most products available in stock.","Backwoods Solar is a company specifically dedicated to serving homes, villages and communities so remote that access to utility lines is not practical. For almost 40 years, we have specialized in independent electric power for the remote off-grid or grid-tied home. We have nine solar electric specialists offering personalized attention to self-reliant home owners who choose and install their own power systems, as well as larger installers doing off-grid battery based and grid-connected solar around the world. 

In the last five years we have expanded our focus to offer remote power for telecom systems, water pumping, clinics and rural villages internationally. What makes us unique is that our technicians live in homes that get their power from the wind, water or sun using the products we sell in our catalog. Our team personally answers all letters, email, and call during business hours, to help with your questions and equipment needs. Your questions will get answered and your needs will More... be met. It is our earnest goal to leave you completely satisfied. 

 Backwoods Solar has been designing off-grid solar, wind, and micro-hydro systems that work without the grid since 1978. Since grid-tie solar systems have become more prevalent, we have used our battery expertise to help design systems that incorporate both the features of utility net metering, with the convenience of battery back-up when outages happen. Back-up power systems do not even have to incorporate solar, since power outages occur most often during times of inclement weather. Many of the standby inverter and battery systems that we design can automatically support a few selected emergency needs during short utility outages. When the utility fails, the system can instantly deliver power to a computer, cash register, pellet stove, or lights for frequent and sometimes longer utility outages. Batteries are kept at fully charged by utility power until an outage, at which time the inverter automatically takes over the selected emergency needs. Additionally, a quiet, durable propane fueled generator set with manual or automatic transfer switch can power the whole house during hours, days, or even weeks of power outage emergency.

 Our experience has taught us that customized systems are better. Power is too important to leave it to a one-size-fits-all product or pre-packaged kit.Let us design a customized system for you. We offer free system design and we'll be there after the sale, too, for the life of the system! Less",www.linkedin.com/company/backwoods-solar,$10 - 24.9 Mil,10-49  Employees,"Inverters

Our Driving Force

It is our goal to increase our customers' competitiveness in a global economy while enhancing safety and protecting employees.

Our Business Philosophy:

In order to be successful, we must sell our goods at a profit and still satisfy our customers. If we satisfy the customer, but fail to make a profit, we will soon be out of business. If we make a profit, but fail to satisfy the customer, we will soon be out of customers. The secret of doing both lies in one word, SERVICE. Service means doing something so valuable for More... the customer that he is glad to pay a price which allows us to make a profit. Less",,$10 - 24.9 Mil,10-49  Employees,"Absorbers
