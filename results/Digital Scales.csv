BUNN Tying Machines are available for meat tying, binding, packaging, label tying, box tying, bakery boxes, printed material, newspapers, metal, restaurant takeout packaging, foam, mailing, newspaper, graphic art/printing, laundry, textile & banking. Tamper-Proof knot that cannot be duplicated by hand under tension loads.","It all started from a notion with a Postal Clerk in Chicago, IL, why not a mechanical tying machine. That was back in 1906 when Romanzo N. Bunn said to his son, Benjamin H. Bunn who was going to Crain Engineering High School. Age 19, Benjamin had invented the Automatic Package Tying Machine for bundling the mail. By the mid 1930's, his invention was now tying Newspapers, laundry, bakery boxes, printed material to name a few. Today, we still have customers using the same machine for over 75 years in their daily production. 

BUNN was GREEN when GREEN was just a COLOR. BUNN Tying Machines can use a variety of materials that meet the customer's needs and those who want environment friendly materials to those who need specific blends of materials or even high temperature twines for bundling metals products to be heat treated.

With Bunns extensive variations of models to choose from, they surely will have one for you and your bundling needs.

BUNN Twines are machine grade twines, most twines don't More... even come close to the specification of BUNN Twines.

 We are still family owned and operated for 115 years.

In 1942, Ted Quarnstrom began Detroit Mold Engineering (later to become D-M-E Company) to provide mold bases in standard sizes, ready for machining of the cavity. This innovation empowered the skilled moldmaker to practice his craft more efficiently and the concept of the standard mold base was born. 

D-M-E is focused on one thing -- to help make moldmakers, molders and mold designers produce better parts. Every D-M-E product cuts costs, reduces time-to-market or improves the finished molded product (sometimes all three). Today, the D-M-E product line encompasses a wide range of products, including: mold bases  D-M-E standard, custom-machined and MoldBasics series, plus Master Unit Die (MUD) quick change, mold systems and components, mold components  ejector pins and sleeves, leader and core pins, mold action devices, mold cooling, interlocks, lifters and other components, 

Moldmaking equipment and supplies More...  cutting tools, polishing and finishing equipment and repair welders, hot runner systems and components  from turnkey hot halves to individual components, mold control systems  solutions for hot runner temperature and other electronic control applications, and technical services  application engineering, field service and product support.
