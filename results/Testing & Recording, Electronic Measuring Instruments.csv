Products include the eyepiece-less inspection and non-contact measurement systems, eyepiece-less microscope, and expanded pupil microscopes. Capabilities include calibrating non-contact measuring systems to meet National Physical Laboratory standards. Calibrating services are also available for microscopes.","With 60 years of manufacturing excellence, we have become one of the world's most innovative and dynamic microscope manufacturers. Our products offer superior optics for inspecting and measuring critical components and are used worldwide for accurate inspection and rework.

Specializing in 'eyepiece-less' optical stereo microscopes, digital and 3D digital inspection, and non-contact/contact measurement systems, we hold world patents for ergonomic optical technology and performance. Our products are widely used in electronics, medical devices, plastics, and general manufacturing facilities worldwide.

The main benefits of our renowned Dynascope (eyepiece-less) technology are the reductions in user eye fatigue and neck strain. Unlike traditional microscopes, where the user is in a fixed working position, our patented design expands the exit pupil of the subject and offers the operator freedom of head and body position. This results in a significant reduction of fatigue and strain and helps More... to improve productivity, accuracy and a reduction in costs.

 The Mantis® and Lynx® families of stereo microscopes offer superb optical images and are used throughout the world for a wide range of inspection, preparation and manipulation tasks requiring hand-to-eye co-ordination.

 For users requiring digital microscopy, our EVO Cam is a full HD high-performance digital microscope ideal for quality control, testing, inspection, and documentation. Without the need for a computer, images are easily captured using a USB memory stick or displayed directly to a monitor.

 Our eyepiece-less technology is also a key feature in our optical range of non-contact measurement systems. We offer optical, video, dual technology (optical and video), and automated systems. Each provides fast and accurate measurement of both routine and complex precision parts, suitable for shop-floor and manufacturing inspection applications.
