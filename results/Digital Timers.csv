In 1942, Ted Quarnstrom began Detroit Mold Engineering (later to become D-M-E Company) to provide mold bases in standard sizes, ready for machining of the cavity. This innovation empowered the skilled moldmaker to practice his craft more efficiently and the concept of the standard mold base was born. 

D-M-E is focused on one thing -- to help make moldmakers, molders and mold designers produce better parts. Every D-M-E product cuts costs, reduces time-to-market or improves the finished molded product (sometimes all three). Today, the D-M-E product line encompasses a wide range of products, including: mold bases Â– D-M-E standard, custom-machined and MoldBasics series, plus Master Unit Die (MUD) quick changeÂ™, mold systems and components, mold components Â– ejector pins and sleeves, leader and core pins, mold action devices, mold cooling, interlocks, lifters and other components, 

Moldmaking equipment and supplies More... Â– cutting tools, polishing and finishing equipment and repair welders, hot runner systems and components Â– from turnkey hot halves to individual components, mold control systems Â– solutions for hot runner temperature and other electronic control applications, and technical services Â– application engineering, field service and product support.
