In fact, almost every one of them is different. It is sometimes difficult to find a company that builds solutions around those needs.

Advanced Poly-Packaging, an industry leader for more than 35 years, is anxious to introduce some of those solutions to you!

A customer recently needed an automatic system to bag pills/vitamins, so we developed a system. Another one wanted to increase speed and automate the bagging of shop towels  a new system was born! Another customer wanted to automate the placement of pre-counted stacks of currency poly bags. We  you know whats coming  came up with a system that works!

Were proud of our latest innovations but also continue to find ways to enhance the products that have stood by our customers for years, like the T-1000 Advanced Poly-Bagger or the T-375 Automatic Tabletop Bagger/Printer. 

Whatever youre bagging  hardware, fasteners, kits or cosmetics  auto parts, mail order, medical or crafts  Advanced More... Poly-Packaging has solutions that increase production and decrease expenses! 

 Allow us to be your one-stop-shop for pre-opened bags on a roll  custom, stock or overrun  all high quality and all manufactured in the USA! Less",,$25 - 49.9 Mil,50-99  Employees,"Sealers: Electronic

In 1942, Ted Quarnstrom began Detroit Mold Engineering (later to become D-M-E Company) to provide mold bases in standard sizes, ready for machining of the cavity. This innovation empowered the skilled moldmaker to practice his craft more efficiently and the concept of the standard mold base was born. 

D-M-E is focused on one thing -- to help make moldmakers, molders and mold designers produce better parts. Every D-M-E product cuts costs, reduces time-to-market or improves the finished molded product (sometimes all three). Today, the D-M-E product line encompasses a wide range of products, including: mold bases  D-M-E standard, custom-machined and MoldBasics series, plus Master Unit Die (MUD) quick change, mold systems and components, mold components  ejector pins and sleeves, leader and core pins, mold action devices, mold cooling, interlocks, lifters and other components, 

Moldmaking equipment and supplies More...  cutting tools, polishing and finishing equipment and repair welders, hot runner systems and components  from turnkey hot halves to individual components, mold control systems  solutions for hot runner temperature and other electronic control applications, and technical services  application engineering, field service and product support.
