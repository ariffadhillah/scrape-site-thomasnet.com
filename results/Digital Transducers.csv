These products are designed for applications where high accuracy, high speed and high reliability in harsh environments is important. The 953 VMAX is GEMCO's newest linear displacement transducer with lab tested shock resistance to 1000 Gs and vibration resistance to 30 Gs. Patented technology allows GEMCO products to outlast competitive products in lumber mills, steel mills, stamping presses, and die-casting applications. 

BW Controls offers an extensive line of sensors for point and continuous liquid level control. B/W Controls uses the same advanced magnetostrictive technology as in GEMCO products providing high accuracy and reliability for continuous liquid level measurement. Continuous level sensors are used in industries such as chemical processing, food and beverage, More... pharmaceutical and petroleum. Point level is used in municipal water and wastewater applications. The advantages of conductivity control over mechanical control include fewer mechanical problems, ease of installation, and operational efficiency that is immune to changes in pressure.

 CATRAC is a line of heavy duty cable and hose carriers that is used on various types of machinery as a means of protecting cables and hoses that convey power, electricity, air, or fluid while the equipment is in motion. The CATRAC line of carriers is known for superior corrosion resistance. It is designed to be maintenance free and comes in a wide variety of sizes with many options available. Aluminum and stainless steel CATRAC is also available as well as a line of SnapTrac nylon carriers.

 GEMCO industrial brakes are field proven, high performance brake systems. They were originally designed and built by Westinghouse and Wagner Industrial Brake Group and purchased by us in the late 1980's. The brakes are tough, reliable, and provide extended, trouble free service. They have been built and designed to the original specifications for more than 40 years. Don't settle for knock-offs, purchase and specify the original Westinghouse and Wagner brakes. Look to Ametek for your hydraulic, magnetic & electro-thrust brake systems.

Herman H. Sticht Company,718-852-7602,https://www.stichtco.com,"Long Beach, NY 11561",Distributor,"Manufacturer and distributor of tachometers, portable, stationary & digital tachometers, vibrating reed, tachometers & stroboscopes, electrostatic neutralizers & static eliminators, tachometer generators. Fluke, Extech, Sperry, AEMC, BK Precision, Amprobe & Wavetek Instruments for megohmmeters, ohmmeters, insulation testers, vibrating reed frequency meters, running time meters.","Vibrating Reed Tachometers (STANDCO)

Vibrating reed tachometers require no power source, so they are ideal for hazardous areas. In addition, they can be safely used on all types of enclosed equipment to accurately measure rotation without the need for contact with high speed shafts. They are economical since there are no accessories and they are virtually maintenance free. Instruments are thoroughly gasketed and moisture-proof.

Stationary Tachometers, Hand-Held Tachometers, Dwarf Tachometers

Type R Stationary Vibrating Reed Tachometers - These vibrating reed tachometers are designed for permanent mounting. They are fitted with lugs to suit the mounting brackets shown below. Enclosed in a gasket, splash proof case, these instruments have a white face with black markings. Available with N.I.S.T. certification.

Type H Hand-Held Vibrating Reed Tachometers - These units are designed to be held against the housing of the equipment being checked. They can also be permanently mounted if desired More... with 8400 and 8401 brackets. Carrying cases are available.

 Static Electricity Eliminators

 Magic Wand Static Neutralizer - The Magic Wand is the safe, cost effective way to eliminate the problems of static electricity in the printing industry and in paper, film, plastic, textile and rubber processing applications. Since it uses no complex electrical or mechanical components, the Magic Wand static neutralizer is low in cost and easy to install without changes in existing machinery. There are no maintenance or operating expenses. The absence of high voltage transformers and cables eliminates the possibility of shocks or sparks caused by faulty insulation. In addition, the Magic Wand static electricity eliminators emits no radioactive rays that could possibly cause health problems. Material being processed can not be damaged by the Magic Wand since there are no sharp points. The Magic Wand can be ordered in special lengths to fit your equipment without additional costs.

 Pocket Laser Tachometers

 The Model MT-1B Pocket Laser Tachometer is a compact and highly accurate industrial measuring instrument designed for ease of use and maximum versatility in the plant and field. With MT-1B measures total revolutions (REV), revolutions-per-minute, and length in yards, feet, and meters.

 Hand Tachometers

 Model MF-2 Combination Hand Tachometer

 Our newest precision tachometer with NIST Certification included.

 Using the latest in microprocessor technology, the MF-2 can be used as a non-contact or a contact tachometer simply by adding or removing the supplied slide-in adapter. It measures RPM from 1 to 99,999 as well as FPM, mPM and IPM.

All Sensors Corp.,408-225-4314,http://www.allsensors.com,"Morgan Hill, CA 95037",Manufacturer,"Custom manufacturer of pressure sensors & transducers & systems. Products include silicon based pressure sensors, pressure sensor systems & manometers. Products range from 1/2 in. water full scale to 100 psi. Industries served include pneumatic controls, medical, environmental & HVAC instrumentation.  RoHS compliant products available on request.","All Sensors Corporation is a leading manufacturer of MEMS piezoresitive pressure sensors and pressure transducers. Our company goal is to manufacture high-accuracy, quality pressure sensors that provide customers with the ideal sensor solution. All Sensors team is comprised of highly talented and experienced individuals who strive to provide our customers with excellent technical information and customer service. Our pressure sensors are specially designed for low-pressure measurement, high accuracy and repeatability. Core competencies such as low pressure, high accuracy and innovative technologies have made All Sensors a reliable sensor supplier for many large OEMs. 

Applications for our sensors are vast. Our pressure sensors perform well in a low pressure, high accuracy environments. A few examples of common applications include ventilators, transport ventilators, sleep apnea, oxygen delivery, drug delivery, portable oxygen therapy, lung spirometry, blood pressure monitoring, hospital More... beds, and electrocardiograms, HVAC monitoring devices, building monitoring systems, environmental monitoring devices, remote sensing, industrial automation, air sampling, air speed, and leak detection. Many of these applications require a low pressure measurement and high accuracy output signal.

 All Sensors manufactures four different types of pressure sensors, basic output (uncompensated sensor), mV output (compensated sensor), amplified output, and digital output. Our basic pressure sensor provides an uncompensated and non-calibrated mV output signal. This device offers a raw output signal and does not compensate for error, such as temperature effects. Basic pressure sensors offer OEMs a low cost sensor that meets the requirements of their application. Secondly, we offer a compensated and calibrated mV output pressure sensor. These sensors are compensated for temperature and calibrated for offset and span. Third, All Sensors manufactures amplified pressure sensors. These sensors or transducers offer a calibrated and compensated output signal that is amplified for the OEM. Lastly All Sensors offers a digital output pressure sensor. These devices are extremely accurate and provide complete digital compensation. Temperature compensated pressure sensors are available in three temperature ranges, commercial (5⁰C to 50(70)⁰C), industrial (-25⁰C to 85⁰C), and military (-40⁰C to 125⁰C). Pressure ranges are available as low as ¼ inH2O and as high as 150PSI.

 All Sensors pressure sensors and transducers are available in several PCB mountable packages with options to fit your application. Custom port fittings and package options are available as well as customizable pressure ranges and performance values. Our team provides engineering assistance to help integrate pressure sensors into your specific application.
