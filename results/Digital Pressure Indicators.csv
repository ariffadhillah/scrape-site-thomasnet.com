Products include button, through-hole, beam, and miniature load cells, reaction and rotary torque sensors, digital panel meters, hand-held indicators, bench top and multi-channel amplifiers, and high- and low-voltage transmitters.

Provides calibration and repair services. Products are available with 1-year limited warranty and 90-day repair warranty. Made in USA.","About Transducer Techniques

Transducer Techniques, LLC established in 1979, designs and manufactures a complete line of load cells, torque sensors, special purpose transducers and related instrumentation. Transducer Techniques, LLC load cells are uniquely designed for weighing and force measurement in such diversified applications as process control, factory automation plus hundreds of other services in every field of science and industry. All transducer sensing elements incorporate bonded foil strain gages wired in a full wheatstone bridge configuration. 

Load cells are electro-mechanical transducers that translate force or weight into voltage. This change in voltage produces, in the read-out instrumentation, a repeatable deflection or indication that can be calibrated directly in terms of the load applied to the cell. 

An important asset of our load cells is their extremely small deflection. The maximum deflection of standard cells does not exceed .012"" at full load. This plus the fact More... that these load cells contain no moving parts, opens unlimited application fields. The inherent compactness of the cells minimizes installation problems. 

 The frequency response characteristics of our load cells are exceptionally good. The relatively low mass, and the small deflection under load, result in a high frequency response which emphasizes use of the cells in many services where other transducers cannot perform.
