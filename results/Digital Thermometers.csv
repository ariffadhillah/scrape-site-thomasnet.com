VEE GEE Scientific was founded by our Chairman, Guy McFarland, in 1981. We are, in essence, an importing wholesaler. We buy alternative brand name product lines in large quantities from overseas and sell worldwide to resellers, primarily laboratory supply companies.

Historically our niche has been supplying the small to medium sized companies who need a price advantage in order to compete. That position has evolved as our product lines have gained recognition as quality brand names preferred in many industries. We continue to supply the small and medium sized distributor, and now find ourselves also supplying some of the largest companies in our field. It is important to note that we hold tightly to a philosophy of importing only products which hold their own in quality comparisons, and which have a stable, long-term future. We could not remain in business if we simply sought the least expensive brands in the world. Without seeming too clichè, our products More... offer the best overall value, not simply the lowest price.

 Our most important asset is our ability to service our customers in a personal yet professional manner. While we are not the largest company in our industry, our commitment to excellence is second to none. Less",,$1 - 4.9 Mil,10-49  Employees,"Thermometers: Digital

Fluke, Extech, Sperry, AEMC, BK Precision, Amprobe & Wavetek Instruments for megohmmeters, ohmmeters, insulation testers, vibrating reed frequency meters, running time meters.","Vibrating Reed Tachometers (STANDCO)

Vibrating reed tachometers require no power source, so they are ideal for hazardous areas. In addition, they can be safely used on all types of enclosed equipment to accurately measure rotation without the need for contact with high speed shafts. They are economical since there are no accessories and they are virtually maintenance free. Instruments are thoroughly gasketed and moisture-proof.

Stationary Tachometers, Hand-Held Tachometers, Dwarf Tachometers

Type R Stationary Vibrating Reed Tachometers - These vibrating reed tachometers are designed for permanent mounting. They are fitted with lugs to suit the mounting brackets shown below. Enclosed in a gasket, splash proof case, these instruments have a white face with black markings. Available with N.I.S.T. certification.

Type H Hand-Held Vibrating Reed Tachometers - These units are designed to be held against the housing of the equipment being checked. They can also be permanently mounted if desired More... with 8400 and 8401 brackets. Carrying cases are available.

 Static Electricity Eliminators

 Magic Wand Static Neutralizer - The Magic Wand is the safe, cost effective way to eliminate the problems of static electricity in the printing industry and in paper, film, plastic, textile and rubber processing applications. Since it uses no complex electrical or mechanical components, the Magic Wand static neutralizer is low in cost and easy to install without changes in existing machinery. There are no maintenance or operating expenses. The absence of high voltage transformers and cables eliminates the possibility of shocks or sparks caused by faulty insulation. In addition, the Magic Wand static electricity eliminators emits no radioactive rays that could possibly cause health problems. Material being processed can not be damaged by the Magic Wand since there are no sharp points. The Magic Wand can be ordered in special lengths to fit your equipment without additional costs.

 Pocket Laser Tachometers

 The Model MT-1B Pocket Laser Tachometer is a compact and highly accurate industrial measuring instrument designed for ease of use and maximum versatility in the plant and field. With MT-1B measures total revolutions (REV), revolutions-per-minute, and length in yards, feet, and meters.

 Hand Tachometers

 Model MF-2 Combination Hand Tachometer

 Our newest precision tachometer with NIST Certification included.

 Using the latest in microprocessor technology, the MF-2 can be used as a non-contact or a contact tachometer simply by adding or removing the supplied slide-in adapter. It measures RPM from 1 to 99,999 as well as FPM, mPM and IPM.

"Jackson Marking Products, Inc.",800-782-6722,http://www.rubber-stamp.com/,"Mount Vernon, IL 62864",Manufacturer,"Manufacturer of rubber stamp making & hot stamping machinery & laser engraved signs & gifts. Manufacturer & distributor of standard & custom rubber stamps & rubber stamp materials. Types of stamps include self-inking, pocket, pre-inked, inspector & pencil cap, hand, die plate band, date, number, laser & rotary engraved & rocker mount stamps. Types of signs include aluminum, stainless steel, plastic, counter & magnetic signs. Engraved gifts include anodized business card holders, wood keychains, pens & pencils, letter openers, pen boxes, photo personalized marble plaques, coaster sets, paper weights, letter opener & gifts boxes. Photopolymer plate washing machinery, stamp die cutters, vulcanizing, drill & handle insertion presses, self-centering vises & pre-inked die inking systems are also available. Capabilities include laser & magnesium engraving, die making & polymer die, matrix & rubber die molding.","The company was originally formed in Chicago in 1961 as Jackson Rubber Stamp Co., making only rubber stamps. Over the years since then many transformations have taken place. 

In 1966 rubber-stamp manufacturing supplies and vulcanizers were added to the product line and the name of the company was changed to Jackson Rubber Stamp and Supply Co. The office was moved to the Chicago suburb of Schiller Park the following year. 

Being a mail-order business, we then decided that an urban location was not required. We moved the business in 1975 to Mt. Vernon, Illinois, in the southern part of the state. A new building was constructed to accommodate the needs of our growing enterprise. 

To more accurately reflect the expanding product line of the firm, in 1980 we changed our name to Jackson Marking Products Co. When our supplier of vulcanizers went out of business in 1983, Jackson Marking began production of our first precision presses. 

Since then, the product line for marking-industry equipment More... has grown significantly. All the machines that Jackson sells are manufactured at our own facility, which has been expanded twice since the move to Mt. Vernon. The company has become a major manufacturer of rubber stamps as well as a premiere industry supplier for raw materials and a highly respected fabricator of equipment for customers worldwide.

Yacht design is a fluid process, and trends can shift like the evening More... breeze. The creativity that goes into every custom panel and electrical system we build stems from a desire to keep Wards Marine Electric in the forefront of our industry. We are constantly striving to provide the most cutting edge services and products. The integration of wireless services and automation control via tablet apps are examples of our ability as industry pioneers. 

 Powered by Innovation

 Innovation is the use of expertise and imagination to create something new. Every department at Wards Marine Electric epitomizes this definition. We have ABYC certified electricians, engineers, technicians, and painters that convert the ordinary into extraordinary every day. From our distributed-logic switchgear systems to our portable boost transformers; innovation is pivotal to our status as a driving force in the world of marine electric.
