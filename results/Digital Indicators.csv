Transducer Techniques, LLC established in 1979, designs and manufactures a complete line of load cells, torque sensors, special purpose transducers and related instrumentation. Transducer Techniques, LLC load cells are uniquely designed for weighing and force measurement in such diversified applications as process control, factory automation plus hundreds of other services in every field of science and industry. All transducer sensing elements incorporate bonded foil strain gages wired in a full wheatstone bridge configuration. 

Load cells are electro-mechanical transducers that translate force or weight into voltage. This change in voltage produces, in the read-out instrumentation, a repeatable deflection or indication that can be calibrated directly in terms of the load applied to the cell. 

An important asset of our load cells is their extremely small deflection. The maximum deflection of standard cells does not exceed .012"" at full load. This plus the fact More... that these load cells contain no moving parts, opens unlimited application fields. The inherent compactness of the cells minimizes installation problems. 

 The frequency response characteristics of our load cells are exceptionally good. The relatively low mass, and the small deflection under load, result in a high frequency response which emphasizes use of the cells in many services where other transducers cannot perform.

 - Quick response and delivery times

 - Development and production even in small part volumes

 - Ultramodern in-house machining facility

 - Comprehensive selection of material types

 Standard parts are extremely versatile in their application and therefore can offer great opportunities. Increased use of standard parts greatly reduces the costs of product development and in turn, provides the engineer with more time to devote on larger project requirements. The engineers can concentrate on the actual machine or equipment design, as standard parts can cost-effectively be procured externally. The wheel does not have to be re-invented, and the creativity in developing can be the focus again. Less",www.linkedin.com/company/2883958,$10 - 24.9 Mil,10-49  Employees,"Indicators: Digital

Fluke, Extech, Sperry, AEMC, BK Precision, Amprobe & Wavetek Instruments for megohmmeters, ohmmeters, insulation testers, vibrating reed frequency meters, running time meters.","Vibrating Reed Tachometers (STANDCO)

Vibrating reed tachometers require no power source, so they are ideal for hazardous areas. In addition, they can be safely used on all types of enclosed equipment to accurately measure rotation without the need for contact with high speed shafts. They are economical since there are no accessories and they are virtually maintenance free. Instruments are thoroughly gasketed and moisture-proof.

Stationary Tachometers, Hand-Held Tachometers, Dwarf Tachometers

Type R Stationary Vibrating Reed Tachometers - These vibrating reed tachometers are designed for permanent mounting. They are fitted with lugs to suit the mounting brackets shown below. Enclosed in a gasket, splash proof case, these instruments have a white face with black markings. Available with N.I.S.T. certification.

Type H Hand-Held Vibrating Reed Tachometers - These units are designed to be held against the housing of the equipment being checked. They can also be permanently mounted if desired More... with 8400 and 8401 brackets. Carrying cases are available.

 Static Electricity Eliminators

 Magic Wand Static Neutralizer - The Magic Wand is the safe, cost effective way to eliminate the problems of static electricity in the printing industry and in paper, film, plastic, textile and rubber processing applications. Since it uses no complex electrical or mechanical components, the Magic Wand static neutralizer is low in cost and easy to install without changes in existing machinery. There are no maintenance or operating expenses. The absence of high voltage transformers and cables eliminates the possibility of shocks or sparks caused by faulty insulation. In addition, the Magic Wand static electricity eliminators emits no radioactive rays that could possibly cause health problems. Material being processed can not be damaged by the Magic Wand since there are no sharp points. The Magic Wand can be ordered in special lengths to fit your equipment without additional costs.

 Pocket Laser Tachometers

 The Model MT-1B Pocket Laser Tachometer is a compact and highly accurate industrial measuring instrument designed for ease of use and maximum versatility in the plant and field. With MT-1B measures total revolutions (REV), revolutions-per-minute, and length in yards, feet, and meters.

 Hand Tachometers

 Model MF-2 Combination Hand Tachometer

 Our newest precision tachometer with NIST Certification included.

 Using the latest in microprocessor technology, the MF-2 can be used as a non-contact or a contact tachometer simply by adding or removing the supplied slide-in adapter. It measures RPM from 1 to 99,999 as well as FPM, mPM and IPM.

Industry-leading manufacturer and distributor of machine monitoring sensors and wireless and wired hazard monitoring systems. Products include shaft speed switches and speed sensors, hazard monitoring systems, belt alignment monitors, bearing temperature sensors, slidegate and valve position sensors, magnetic pulser discs and wraps, motor ring kits and encoders, tachometers and process counters, vibration monitors, potentiometers, and signal conditioners. Easy mounting brackets, mounting magnets, and disc guards are also available. Five-year warranty on most standard products.","Electro-Sensors, Inc. began operations in 1968 in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. It was founded by James P. Slattery to serve material handling and process control applications in industrial plants. The original products included the Bin-Levetrol level sensor which sensed presence or absence of material and functioned as a high or low level control for bins or hoppers used in dry bulk material handling systems. Another core product was a speed monitor for monitoring critical shaft speeds and was used on conveyor belts, screw conveyors, bucket elevators, and similar process equipment. This speed monitor would shut off the driven equipment if proper speed was not maintained. 

As the company grew, other sensing technologies and products were added to monitor temperature, vibration, or position in industrial applications. These products include shaft speed sensors, shaft speed switches, bearing temperature sensors, belt misalignment devices, vibration switches, position monitors for slide gates More... and valves, tilt switches, motor speed controllers, and complete hazard monitoring systems for processing plants.

 Electro-Sensors, Inc. consistently produces the most reliable speed control and motion detection systems available, utilizing leading-edge technology to continuously improve our products and make them easier to use. Our goal is to manufacture the industry-preferred product for every market we serve. We do this through total quality commitment, by completely fulfilling our customers' expectations.

 Electro-Sensors, Inc. contributes real value to the marketplace by providing complete, ready-to-install systems. These systems are delivered promptly and are supported by knowledgeable technical support, providing total customer service. We appreciate our many loyal customers who depend upon our products every day to help run their plants with greater efficiency, productivity, and control.

 No matter how unique or complex your manufacturing environment, chances are that Electro-Sensors has encountered a similar challenge. A dedicated staff of applications engineers and years of experience combine with the industry's most advanced technology to deliver reliable solutions that can perform at or above industry standards.
