Industry-leading manufacturer and distributor of machine monitoring sensors and wireless and wired hazard monitoring systems. Products include shaft speed switches and speed sensors, hazard monitoring systems, belt alignment monitors, bearing temperature sensors, slidegate and valve position sensors, magnetic pulser discs and wraps, motor ring kits and encoders, tachometers and process counters, vibration monitors, potentiometers, and signal conditioners. Easy mounting brackets, mounting magnets, and disc guards are also available. Five-year warranty on most standard products.","Electro-Sensors, Inc. began operations in 1968 in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. It was founded by James P. Slattery to serve material handling and process control applications in industrial plants. The original products included the Bin-Levetrol level sensor which sensed presence or absence of material and functioned as a high or low level control for bins or hoppers used in dry bulk material handling systems. Another core product was a speed monitor for monitoring critical shaft speeds and was used on conveyor belts, screw conveyors, bucket elevators, and similar process equipment. This speed monitor would shut off the driven equipment if proper speed was not maintained. 

As the company grew, other sensing technologies and products were added to monitor temperature, vibration, or position in industrial applications. These products include shaft speed sensors, shaft speed switches, bearing temperature sensors, belt misalignment devices, vibration switches, position monitors for slide gates More... and valves, tilt switches, motor speed controllers, and complete hazard monitoring systems for processing plants.

 Electro-Sensors, Inc. consistently produces the most reliable speed control and motion detection systems available, utilizing leading-edge technology to continuously improve our products and make them easier to use. Our goal is to manufacture the industry-preferred product for every market we serve. We do this through total quality commitment, by completely fulfilling our customers' expectations.

 Electro-Sensors, Inc. contributes real value to the marketplace by providing complete, ready-to-install systems. These systems are delivered promptly and are supported by knowledgeable technical support, providing total customer service. We appreciate our many loyal customers who depend upon our products every day to help run their plants with greater efficiency, productivity, and control.

 No matter how unique or complex your manufacturing environment, chances are that Electro-Sensors has encountered a similar challenge.
