Kampi is a multi-million dollar company which provides distribution management services relating to military logistical support. Kampi's services enable manufactures and OEM's to offer their products at the best value to the military end user. Incorporated in 1984, Kampi has become one of the world's largest military shipping companies and a leading provider of specialized military packaging and logistical services. Kampi employs approximately 65 people who are engaged in the procurement, inspection, testing, packaging and transportation of products intended for U.S. military use. The company has prospered in the past 30 years as a leader in military equipment and parts distribution, but it has also faced many economic challenges in its history. There have More... been reductions in U.S. manufacturing sources, global and U.S. economic instability, as well as fierce global competition over government spending dollars for U.S. military spares. Despite these challenges, Kampi has kept a firm grip on its market share. In addition, the evolving methods used by the Department of Defense to procure military end use material, along with the tight competition for government spares contracts was especially hard on many military distributors. It was during this time that Kampi met and passed several key challenges. While other competitors fell by the wayside, Kampi has managed not only to remain strong, but to continue to grow. In 2000, Kampi relocated to a state of the art 25,000 square foot distribution facility located in Fairless Hills, PA. Kampi Components is now a distribution company with one of the most recognized names in the Defense Logistics Agency and Department of Defense community. Kampi's commitment to success in the future is firmly under way by continuing to invest in the technology, equipment, and personnel training necessary to set it apart from the crowd.

Microprocessor Systems For Data Acquisition, Measurement Of Torque, RPM, Power, Energy, Temperature, Force, Flow Pressure, Weight Displacement, Time Velocity, Volts, AMPS, Watts, Frequency, Efficiency, Counting, Classification","S. Himmelstein and Company is a U.S. manufacturer of torque sensors and signal conditioners. Focused solely on torque since 1960, Himmelstein boasts an expansive product line and a highly accurate knowledge base. Located in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, Himmelstein continues to enhance and improve our torque sensors to provide the best torque measurement solutions.

The Himmelstein Advantage

Best real-world accuracy of any torquemeter, torque sensor, or torque transducer.

S. Himmelstein and Company has been designing and manufacturing the world's best torque measurement transducers and instrumentation since 1960. Our products offer significant advantages over competitive models, enhancing their overall performance under real-world conditions, not just in the calibration stand.

Highest available mechanical overloads:

Select from 200 percent, 400 percent, 500 percent and 1,000 percent overload models. The flexibility to select sensor mechanical overload allows optimal sizing of the sensor to More... suit the application, even in the presence of peak torques that exceed the average running torque. This ensures the best measurement accuracy for the application. For assistance is sizing/selecting the proper torque sensor, please refer to our bulletin entitled Choosing the Correct Torque Transducer.

 High Electrical Overrange:

 All Himmelstein torque transducers and instruments with high-level DC analog output voltages have significant electrical overrange (130 percent to 300 percent depending on model). All rotating mechanical systems have oscillatory signals. When operating at or near full scale, insufficient overrange on the output signal will cause clipping of the peak values and result in an incorrect display of the average torque. By offering significant electrical overrange, Himmelstein transducers provide accurate measurement, even beyond full scale. 

 Himmelstein bearingless torque flanges are the best choice for dynamic measurement and control. That's because the world's highest torsional stiffness yields wider installed bandwidth and faster installed response than any competitive device. Our flanges also feature the industry's highest overrange and greatest isolation from clamping and other extraneous loads. Those features reduce errors from clipped torque peaks and parasitic loads. 

 Superior temperature compensation results in sensor temperature performance that greatly reduces errors caused by drive heating and thermal gradients. This level of temperature performance allows S. Himmelstein and Company to offer dual-range torque transducers with high accuracy.

Early projects included CA inspection solutions using PC-based frame grabber boards, CCD cameras and programmable I/O devices. Over time, CA added inspection functionality, data collection, and a new graphical user interface. These features led to the 1998 introduction of CA's revolutionary EZVision Product family. As machine vision technology continued to expand into smart cameras, CA accepted the changes and in 2002 began to offer vision integration services for customer's interested in Cognex, DVT, Keyence and other brands. Project requirements grew to complete automated inspection machines, so CA added mechanical design and build a capability to their engineering resources.

Today, CA offers turnkey inspection, automation and test machines that utilize: PC and/or PLC based controls, data collection, machine vision cameras, laser More... measurement sensors, load cells, LVDTs, pressure and leak detectors, servos, robots, laser etching, conveyors, feeder bowls and a host of other components required to meet customer's ever increasing demands.

AUTOMOTIVE

Dow-Gages are currently used by our automotive customers for gaging components of fuel systems, diesel injection systems, anti-lock braking systems, supplemental restraint systems, steering and transmission parts, and other critical components.

HYDRAULIC FITTINGS AND VALVES

Dow-Gages can be found on the shop floor of many of the largest hydraulic fittings manufacturers in The United States, Canada, The United Kingdom, and South Korea.

FIREARMS

For over fifty years, we have provided gaging to the major firearms manufacturers as well as to The United States Government. Our gages have been used to check dimensions of components in pistols, shotguns, rifles, and automatic weapons.

MILITARY ORDNANCE

From the days of the Korean War to the present, Dow-Gages have been used in the inspection of fuse and projectile components of many of the major munitions and military ordnance manufacturers.

DOMESTIC

Major manufacturers of items such as acetylene welding torches, small More... hand tools, small gasoline engines and ignition systems, machine tools, and domestic plumbing components use customized Dow-Gages for in-process and post-process inspection on the shop floor.

 SCREW MACHINE PRODUCTS

 Customized Dow-Gages can be found in large and small screw machine shops throughout The United States and Canada. The wide variety of dimensional characteristics found in a typical screw machined part provide excellent applications for this type of fast, flexible, and accurate gaging.
