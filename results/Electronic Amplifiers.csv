We presently house 20,000 square feet of modern clerical, management and engineering offices, product development and environmental test laboratories, and efficient production hardware manufacturing and test centers.

Our 2,000 square foot environmental test lab houses two computer controlled centrifuges utilized for setup and final calibration of our Linear Servo product line. The systems are capable of generating static accelerations up to 200 G's. In addition, another dual centrifuge system gives Columbia the unique ability to generate a dynamic +/- G modulation of a specimen while being subjected to a constant static acceleration. Another unique centrifuge at Columbia's facility provides static acceleration at temperature. This system has successfully accelerated sensors to over 600 G at temperature. A 1,500 square foot clean More... room is utilized for assembly of our precision torque mechanisms.

 Columbia's piezoelectric product test laboratory incorporates three calibration-grade vibration shaker systems with two additional smaller temperature/vibration measurement systems. This facility offers both Hopkinson Bar and Avco Drop Test Shock Generation Test Stands with digital computing oscilloscope displays. Production accelerometer insert level cross axis measurements are conducted on our 360 degrees variable rotation 10 Hz slide table cross axis test stand. Design qualification base strain performance measurements can be made with a shaker-driven beam test configuration.

 The first floor of our facility houses Alibert Industries, a fully-equipped 4,000 square foot machine shop which incorporates the latest in CNC milling and machining equipment. Alibert Industries subcontracts exclusively to Columbia Research on a 100% basis to meet our product development and production metal fabrication needs. One thing that separate's Columbia from many of our competitors is our ability to keep all the steps of the manufacturing process in-house.

Aerotech's precision motion control products provide the critical performance for today's demanding applications in markets such as medical device and life sciences, semiconductor and flat panel, photonics, automotive, data storage, laser processing, military/aerospace, electronics manufacturing, test, assembly, research and development, and other markets requiring high precision, high throughput motion solutions.

Aerotech's commitment to consistently advancing our product and value-added service capabilities is summed up in our motto, Dedicated to the Science of Motion. Always guiding our development efforts is our commitment to providing our customers with products and services that provide:

 The lowest cost of ownership

 Highest throughput

 Highest More... accuracy

  Best return on investment

 Our philosophy of building superior motion control systems starts with designing and manufacturing technically superior components. Other suppliers integrate general purpose components into their motion systems and claim to sell you a ""superior"" system. An Aerotech system begins with Aerotech motion components that are already best in class and specifically designed and optimized for the highest performance and lowest cost of ownership available.

 From technically superior components to high performance sub-assemblies to best-in-class, highly integrated motion subsystems, Aerotech can accommodate the requirements of your application and outperform competitive solutions.

 The performance of our products is complemented by the depth and breadth of our product line, providing our customers with a one-stop supplier for a quick and efficient solution for your application.

 If you don't find a standard product suitable for your application, our expertise and ability to provide custom motion components and systems is unmatched in the industry. Our custom manufacturing ability is further augmented by our long history of providing systems for vacuum and cleanroom operation.

 From concept to final certification, Aerotech's engineers and technical staff apply their expertise and skills, along with Aerotech's proven products and motion control and positioning technologies, to ensure the success of our custom engineered systems. Our advanced analytical and diagnostic capabilities allow us to provide a very high level of engineering and service support, providing an extra level of value-added services for our customers.

 Aerotech is committed to supporting its customers worldwide. We maintain a growing number of direct field sales and engineering offices throughout the U.S., as well as representatives across the globe.

Gage types include air, bore, coating thickness, electronic, groove, height, non-contact, snap, compensated temperature, thread, torque, and ultrasonic thickness gages. Inspection equipment includes gage blocks, hardness testers, micrometers and calipers, spring and force testers, surface plates, coordinate measuring machines, microscopes, optical comparators, SPC systems, and video and image inspection systems and accessories. Capabilities include design and build of specials to handle specific requirements, special work holders and slides to hold or move parts through gages, integration of gaging equipment to computers and process controllers, on-site demonstration equipment, set-up, calibration and training on major instruments and full certifications traceable to NIST standards. Meter repair and calibration services include electronic measurement using test equipment.","Measure-All, Inc. has specialized in the area of gaging and inspection equipment for over 25 years. We represent some of the finest manufacturers of measuring equipment produced in the world.

One of the keys to our success has been the ability to solve our customer's problems! Measure-All has the capability to provide a variety of standard gage systems or to design and build special products to handle the specific requirements. For example: champer gages, Universal run-out fixtures, thread depth gages, Snap OD gages, etc. Because of our diversity, Measure-All can usually find a standard product (that might require slight modification) to solve the gaging requirement.

Measure-All can also provide Turn-key Measuring Systems. If a customer needs a CMM, Optical Comparator or Laser System, we can also supply special work holding fixtures and slides to hold or move the part through the gage. Because of our knowledge of the equipment specifications and limitations, Measure-All can design a complete More... package that would optimize the measuring solution. 

 Measure-All is also very involved in the integration of gaging equipment to computers and process controllers. We have the capability of integrating about any type of gage to SPC Data Collection. Our knowledge of SPC and gage R&R aid in our ability of solving TOTAL customer needs. If required, we can supply full certification traceable to NIST standards and full gage R&R on gaging and fixtures supplied to our customers. 

 In conclusion, Measure-All has the ability to serve our customers total gaging requirements. Whether it be a $250,000.00 automated inspection system or a $20.00 go/nogo plug gage, we have the tools and knowledge to solve your problems. Please allow us the opportunity to work with you and help your specific gaging and measuring needs. Less",,$1 - 4.9 Mil,1-9  Employees,Amplifiers: Electronic,"All Products / Services
