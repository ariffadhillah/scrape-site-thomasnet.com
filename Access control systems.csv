Made in the USA.","In the mid-1960s Charles and Eleanor Garrett introduced the world to The Hunter, the first Zero Drift, Dual Searchcoil detector ever made. And with it they espoused a new philosophy that challenged the way the world would forever view the metal detection industry. ""We will build the best possible metal detector and offer the best customer service,"" they said. 

40 years later, as you can imagine, we're still passionate about our detectors. In fact, you might even say we're a little over zealous. But, whether your treasure's been resting at the bottom of the sea for centuries, buried in an old battlefield for decades or lost at the park yesterday, you can rest assured Garrett has engineered the right detector that will fit your needs and budget.",,$25 - 49.9 Mil,100-199  Employees,"Access Control Systems

Printer widths vary from 2-1/4 in. to 8-1/2 in. with and without cutters and presenters. Also manufacturers of OEM cutters in various widths for use with printers and other products.","The history of Hengstler actually dates back over more than 150 years. At the beginning in 1846, the clock-maker Johannes Hengstler started the series production of gongs in the Swabian town of Aldingen in Germany. In the course of the following decades the foundation was laid for the comprehensive experience Hengstler has today with the production of counters, printers, cutters, relays and encoders. Meanwhile controllers, length and angular measuring systems have expanded the product range. In 1995 Hengstler became a member of the US corporation Danaher in Washington, DC. Danaher Corporation regularly attains annual sales of several billion US dollars. Its main business segments also comprise tools and components, process and environmental controls, Hengstler being part of the latter business segment as a focused niche business.

One of our particular strengths is the complete management of customer-specific application projects. We can provide effective and continuous support from the More... project planning and design phase right through to the finished product. Our core competence is your benefit. Apart from our long and varied experience in electromechanical and mechanical engineering, pneumatics and electronics - which is reflected in our product range - we also have special strengths in the following fields:
