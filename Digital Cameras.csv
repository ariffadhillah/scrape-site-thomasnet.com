Products include the eyepiece-less inspection and non-contact measurement systems, eyepiece-less microscope, and expanded pupil microscopes. Capabilities include calibrating non-contact measuring systems to meet National Physical Laboratory standards. Calibrating services are also available for microscopes.","With 60 years of manufacturing excellence, we have become one of the world's most innovative and dynamic microscope manufacturers. Our products offer superior optics for inspecting and measuring critical components and are used worldwide for accurate inspection and rework.

Specializing in 'eyepiece-less' optical stereo microscopes, digital and 3D digital inspection, and non-contact/contact measurement systems, we hold world patents for ergonomic optical technology and performance. Our products are widely used in electronics, medical devices, plastics, and general manufacturing facilities worldwide.

The main benefits of our renowned Dynascope (eyepiece-less) technology are the reductions in user eye fatigue and neck strain. Unlike traditional microscopes, where the user is in a fixed working position, our patented design expands the exit pupil of the subject and offers the operator freedom of head and body position. This results in a significant reduction of fatigue and strain and helps More... to improve productivity, accuracy and a reduction in costs.

 The Mantis® and Lynx® families of stereo microscopes offer superb optical images and are used throughout the world for a wide range of inspection, preparation and manipulation tasks requiring hand-to-eye co-ordination.

 For users requiring digital microscopy, our EVO Cam is a full HD high-performance digital microscope ideal for quality control, testing, inspection, and documentation. Without the need for a computer, images are easily captured using a USB memory stick or displayed directly to a monitor.

 Our eyepiece-less technology is also a key feature in our optical range of non-contact measurement systems. We offer optical, video, dual technology (optical and video), and automated systems. Each provides fast and accurate measurement of both routine and complex precision parts, suitable for shop-floor and manufacturing inspection applications.

High-speed imaging is an engineering tool, much as is an oscilloscope or a computer. It is a photographic technique that enables the process to visualize & analyze physical phenomena, especially motion that is too fast for the human eye or conventional cameras to perceive. In entertainment & art applications it is applied where the emotional impact of slow-motion is desired. Designs & manufactures high-speed digital imaging systems. Micro cameras are small, lightweight & untethered from a computer are suitable for mobile applications or situations where size & weight might be an issue. A broad line of performance cameras with resolution, speed & light-sensitivity that can be used with industrial tools, digital cinema & HD television productions.","High speed photography is an engineering tool, much as is an oscilloscope or a computer. It is a photographic technique that enables us to visualize and analyze motion especially motions that are too fast for the human eye or conventional cameras to perceive.

During the first forty two years of the company's existence high speed photographic images were generally ""captured"" on photographic film. The company excelled in teaching and applying high speed photography to numerous clients for a multitude of applications. The company also designed , manufactured and marketed products specific to the high speed photographic needs of its clients. The company's film based cameras were so widely accepted that they are national stock listed (NSN) by the US DoD.

In 1992 the company decided to form a separate entity that was to design and fabricate high speed electronic imagers that did not rely on photographic film for imaging. That ""spin off"" was later to be known as Vision Research® Inc. and their More... family of electronic imagers is currently marketed under the ""Phantom®"" trade mark.

 Vision Research prides itself in the high resolution of its images, the power of its software, the reliability of its products and its high level of attentiveness and dedication to its customers. The company's innovative approach to high speed electronic ""digital"" imaging was recognized by the US Patent Office and was granted US Patent #5,625,412.

 The future holds more technology innovation and unique products from Vision Research. The company's development goals include electronic imaging products with higher resolution and faster frame rates and ""smarter"" cameras with more powerful and robust software.

 While hardware and software products are important, the company realizes that its key to future success is the same now as it was in 1950 and that is listening to and serving its customers. Less",www.linkedin.com/company/vision-research,$250 Mil. and over,10-49  Employees,"Cameras: Digital

Refractometer calibration service is also available.","About VEE GEE Scientific, Inc.

VEE GEE Scientific was founded by our Chairman, Guy McFarland, in 1981. We are, in essence, an importing wholesaler. We buy alternative brand name product lines in large quantities from overseas and sell worldwide to resellers, primarily laboratory supply companies.

Historically our niche has been supplying the small to medium sized companies who need a price advantage in order to compete. That position has evolved as our product lines have gained recognition as quality brand names preferred in many industries. We continue to supply the small and medium sized distributor, and now find ourselves also supplying some of the largest companies in our field. It is important to note that we hold tightly to a philosophy of importing only products which hold their own in quality comparisons, and which have a stable, long-term future. We could not remain in business if we simply sought the least expensive brands in the world. Without seeming too clichè, our products More... offer the best overall value, not simply the lowest price.

 Our most important asset is our ability to service our customers in a personal yet professional manner. While we are not the largest company in our industry, our commitment to excellence is second to none. Less",,$1 - 4.9 Mil,10-49  Employees,"Cameras: Digital
