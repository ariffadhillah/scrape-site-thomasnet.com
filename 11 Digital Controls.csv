"Proportion-Air, Inc.",888-451-8074,https://proportionair.com/,"McCordsville, IN 46055",Manufacturer,"Manufacturer of made to order pressure, vacuum & flow control products including electronic air pressure control valves & regulators, air flow control valves & closed loop electro-pneumatic controls. Products include regulators, precision pressure regulators, pressure control valves, flow monitors and flow controllers, pressure sensors, potentiometers, panel meters, power supplies, power cords, brackets & inline sintered filters. Capabilities include design engineering, prototyping, testing & validation. Capabilities include converting, die cast, dispensing, injection molding, process control, spraying & welding applications. Capabilities include application assistance & fast quoting (within 6 hours). Markets served include aerospace, automotive, environmental, food processing, glass, instrumentation, medical, laser, optical instruments & lenses, packaging, pharmaceutical, plastics, pulp & paper, railroad, robotics, rubber, semiconductor, specialty machinery, textile & tire industries. Made in the USA.","Proportion-Air is the world's leading manufacturer of electronic air pressure and air flow rate control valves and regulators. Each product is custom made to your specifications after sharing your needs directly with our applications staff. Our competition builds thousands of products to fill their catalogs. Proportion-Air builds only electronic pressure and flow controls, built thousands of ways to meet each customer's exacting requirements.

Electronic pressure control valves:

Proportion-Air designs and manufactures pneumatic control valves for the most demanding applications: low pressures (0-2 inches H2O), high pressures (0-69 bar), high flow rates (0-85000 slpm), high resolution (+/-0.005% of full scale), shock and vibration resistant up to 25 G's, tolerant of condensates and lube oils, oxygen clean and oxygen compatible, vacuum calibrations, vacuum through positive pressure calibrations, and absolute pressure calibrations. Proportion-Air offers most products in a single loop model More... where output pressure is closed loop around an internal pressure sensor. Many products are offered in two loop models where a second external feedback sensor can be used to correct for hysteresis in pressure regulation for higher accuracy. Nearly any pressure and flow can be achieved and controlled when we introduce pilot-operated regulators.

 Electronic mass flow control valves:

 Proportion-Air manufactures an industrial quality mass flow transducer for air and inert gases. Flow is calculated based on differential pressure across an internal venturi. This pressure based flow makes the F-series flow transducer very fast (<10mS). The F-series converts flow rate into an electronic signal that may be directly used to measure flow rates electrically. The F-series is also used as a feedback signal to Proportion-Air pneumatic control valves to create a closed loop mass flow control package. Packages are available as low as 2-20 scfm (0.9-9.4 slpm) and as high as 25-250 scfm (708-780 slpm).

 Two other brands make up the Proportion-Air family:

 Burling Valve brand direct-acting and dome-loaded pressure regulators are designed for the process industries. All Burling Valve process regulators and valves are made in the USA and offer free application support, quick quotes, great lead times and custom engineered solutions. Back pressure, pressure reducing, differential and negative-bias regulators are all available.

 Protect-Air USA miniature safety regulators operation of pneumatic tools and compressed air systems. All Protect-Air products are intended to increase efficiency, protect employees, protect equipment and ensure cost saving production throughout all levels of the manufacturing environment. Our number one consideration is to offer customers added value through broad and deep product lines, knowledge, processing and world class customer service.

Custom Design

Each product we design is specifically tailored to your specifications. Our sales engineers work with you every step of the way to make sure that your project turns out the way you want it to. They don't use the ""hard sell"" to force you into something that you don't want. Rather, they draw on years of experience to guide you through the tough choices like:

* Component choice

* Efficiency

* Reliability

* Scalability

* Implementation

So when your ready to let us help you design and implement your next project Contact Us and let's work together to bring your idea to fruition.

End to End Service

Our service technicians don't stop with More... our products. In fact, we pride ourselves on providing our customers with industry leading service that extends well beyond our product lines. If you have an issue in the field our technicians will work with you to pinpoint the issue no matter where it lies. Whether it's in the hydraulic system (e.g. bad coils), engine (e.g. engine fault analysis), or electrical system (e.g. short, overload, open load); We'll work with you until the issue is resolved or a plan of action is in place.

 Repairable Products

 In today's world most products seem to be ""throw away"" by design. Meaning that if it breaks just throw it away and get a new one. Well that's not good enough for us. Our products are completely repairable. Our repair technicians are skilled at repairing all of our products down to the component level. What's more is that we offer 24 hour turn around on repairs. What this means for you is that you can send your product back to us and we'll repair it and ship it back to you within 24 hours. Granted, there are situations where this is not possible (i.e specialized parts that need to be ordered), but, we make every effort to make sure you have your item back quickly so there is minimal down time.

Also manufacturers of OEM cutters in various widths for use with printers and other products.","The history of Hengstler actually dates back over more than 150 years. At the beginning in 1846, the clock-maker Johannes Hengstler started the series production of gongs in the Swabian town of Aldingen in Germany. In the course of the following decades the foundation was laid for the comprehensive experience Hengstler has today with the production of counters, printers, cutters, relays and encoders. Meanwhile controllers, length and angular measuring systems have expanded the product range. In 1995 Hengstler became a member of the US corporation Danaher in Washington, DC. Danaher Corporation regularly attains annual sales of several billion US dollars. Its main business segments also comprise tools and components, process and environmental controls, Hengstler being part of the latter business segment as a focused niche business.

"Electro-Sensors, Inc.",800-328-6170,https://www.electro-sensors.com/,"Minnetonka, MN 55343-9108",Manufacturer,"ISO 9001:2008 certified. Industry-leading manufacturer and distributor of machine monitoring sensors and wireless and wired hazard monitoring systems. Products include shaft speed switches and speed sensors, hazard monitoring systems, belt alignment monitors, bearing temperature sensors, slidegate and valve position sensors, magnetic pulser discs and wraps, motor ring kits and encoders, tachometers and process counters, vibration monitors, potentiometers, and signal conditioners. Easy mounting brackets, mounting magnets, and disc guards are also available. Five-year warranty on most standard products.","Electro-Sensors, Inc. began operations in 1968 in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. It was founded by James P. Slattery to serve material handling and process control applications in industrial plants. The original products included the Bin-Levetrol level sensor which sensed presence or absence of material and functioned as a high or low level control for bins or hoppers used in dry bulk material handling systems. Another core product was a speed monitor for monitoring critical shaft speeds and was used on conveyor belts, screw conveyors, bucket elevators, and similar process equipment. This speed monitor would shut off the driven equipment if proper speed was not maintained. 

As the company grew, other sensing technologies and products were added to monitor temperature, vibration, or position in industrial applications. These products include shaft speed sensors, shaft speed switches, bearing temperature sensors, belt misalignment devices, vibration switches, position monitors for slide gates More... and valves, tilt switches, motor speed controllers, and complete hazard monitoring systems for processing plants.

 Electro-Sensors, Inc. consistently produces the most reliable speed control and motion detection systems available, utilizing leading-edge technology to continuously improve our products and make them easier to use. Our goal is to manufacture the industry-preferred product for every market we serve. We do this through total quality commitment, by completely fulfilling our customers' expectations.

 Electro-Sensors, Inc. contributes real value to the marketplace by providing complete, ready-to-install systems. These systems are delivered promptly and are supported by knowledgeable technical support, providing total customer service. We appreciate our many loyal customers who depend upon our products every day to help run their plants with greater efficiency, productivity, and control.

 No matter how unique or complex your manufacturing environment, chances are that Electro-Sensors has encountered a similar challenge. A dedicated staff of applications engineers and years of experience combine with the industry's most advanced technology to deliver reliable solutions that can perform at or above industry standards.
