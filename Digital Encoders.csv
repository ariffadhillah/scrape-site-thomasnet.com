"Elinco International JPC, Inc.",203-334-7537,https://www.e-jpc.com/,"Fairfield, CT 06824",Manufacturer,"Manufacturer of thermal and motion control solutions. Thermal control products are fans, impellers, and blowers. Motion control products are brushless and permanent magnet DC, AC, and stepping motors. Also offers accessories such as motor couplings and sensors and fan trays, filters, finger guards, flange spacers, and inlet rings. Available in various features and specifications. Provides returns, exchanges, and limited warranty.","Electric Indicator Company (ELINCO) was founded in 1926 in Stamford, Connecticut to manufacture instruments and controls for electric utility companies. It entered the specialty fractional horsepower motor business around the beginning of World War II and has been designing and manufacturing high performance precision electric motors in Connecticut ever since. The company moved to Wilton Connecticut in 1962, and then to Norwalk, Connecticut in 1973, and again to Fairfield and Bridgeport Connecticut in 2000, where it currently resides. In 2000 some US motor manufacturing operations were relocated to Asia with light manufacturing and value add consolidated to Fairfield and Bridgeport.

In 1991 Elinco acquired Japanese Products Corporation. This added a large salesforce for distribution and high technology products from Nidec-Servo (formerly Japan Servo). Nidec is a $12 bil. manufacturer of Brushless DC motors worldwide.

Japanese Products Corporation was founded by an engineer from Perkin Elmer More... in 1969, and was initiated to sell the motors and fans of Japan Servo Company (now Nidec Servo) throughout North America. The company grew rapidly in the 1970's and 1980's in diverse markets including Hard Disk Drives, supplying the drive's motor. JPC continues to expand in the 1990's and 2000's in multiple industries including medical devices, lighting, automotive, telecommunications, and many others. JPC's sister company Elinco International, Inc. manufactures brushless DC motors.

 Elinco JPC has several executives and managers with extensive experience with motors and air moving products. The company has a strong sales network throughout North America, as well as working relationships throughout Asia and Europe. Elinco JPC's principle line of business is brushless DC motors and cooling fans, and value add operations of encoders, gears, gearboxes or gear systems, and standalone drivers/controllers or fully integrated motion or cooling systems.

 Elinco JPC pioneered the development of the Hysteresis Synchronous motor and was a leader in this technology. In the early 1980's, ELINCO recognized the inherent advantages of brushless D.C. motors and developed the slotless brushless D.C. motor, which gives unique performance (see Whitepaper Why ""SLOTLESS"" brushless DC motors?). This has resulted in a strong proprietary and patented position with ""slotless"" brushless D.C. motor technology. The company has produced over 6000 slotless brushless D.C. motors.

 Elinco JPC acquired the General Electric SELSYN (self-synchronous) motor line in 1993. In 1994 ELINCO JPC acquired the Inertial motor product line and relocated the line from Doylestown, Pennsylvania to the Norwalk plant. The Inertial products have extremely low inertia and accelerate to 5000 RPM in less the one millisecond. In 1994 Elinco JPC acquired a part of the Philips Airpax motor line.

Merritt provides innovative custom human interface solutions, including precision engineered joystick controllers and operator armchair systems, for a wide variety of applications. Founded in the mid-1980s, J.R. Merritt began by offering the metals industry a different type of joystick to replace the hard-to-operate high spring force joysticks then being used. These new rugged, low spring force joysticks were readily accepted due to their operator-friendliness and durability. 

J.R. Merritt soon added seating and seating system solutions to our product line, and we were then able to offer a complete turnkey solution to the market. We continued to expand our market base, and today we also provide a full range of cost-effective joysticks, based on our same original design principles, to control machinery in the mobile equipment industry. 

Our comprehensive line of multi-axis joysticks includes heavy mill duty, mill duty, heavy industrial and finger-operated models. The heavier duty joysticks More... provide reliable control in applications as varied as cranes, forestry equipment, in-plant process control, mining, offshore drilling, bucket trucks, boom lifts and aerial work platforms. The finger-operated joysticks are used for precise finger operation for test, measurement and guidance equipment and radio control systems. 

 Single axis controllers from J.R. Merritt are available for heavy mill duty, mill duty, industrial/hydraulic and finger-operated applications, as well as for operator-to-rail equipment interface. These drive/brake controllers are ideal for propulsion and brake control on locomotives, rapid transit, high-speed rail trains, trams, trolleys and people movers.

 J.R. Merritt offers a complete line of armchair systems to meet the needs of diverse applications, from cab-operated cranes and process line pulpits to control rooms and mining shovels. The rotating operator armchairs are furnished with integrated consoles and numerous manual adjustments and some are specifically designed for tight cabins. 

 Complementary products such as rotary switches, foot pedals, enclosures and output devices round out the J.R. Merritt line. All are designed for long life and reliable operation. Less",www.linkedin.com/company/j-r-merritt-controls-inc,$5 - 9.9 Mil,10-49  Employees,"Encoders: Digital

Our industrial-grade encoders provide your system with the durability it needs to consistently operate the way it should.

The ever-increasing operating speeds of today demand an encoder that is durable and resistant to vibration, shaft run-out and axial movement. Our encoders feature a robust dual-bearing design and an overhang load capability that is 3x the industry average to compensate for these common issues and to prevent any unnecessary encoder related downtimes.

All EMP Encoders carry a one-year warranty and are 100-percent plant tested. Our dual-bearing encoders are shock resistant and available in the following sizes:
