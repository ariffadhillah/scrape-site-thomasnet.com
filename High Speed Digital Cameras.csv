"Vision Research, Inc",800-737-6588,https://www.phantomhighspeed.com/,"Wayne, NJ 07470 | Locations",Manufacturer,"Manufacturer & sells digital high-speed imaging systems. High-speed imaging is an engineering tool, much as is an oscilloscope or a computer. It is a photographic technique that enables the process to visualize & analyze physical phenomena, especially motion that is too fast for the human eye or conventional cameras to perceive. In entertainment & art applications it is applied where the emotional impact of slow-motion is desired. Designs & manufactures high-speed digital imaging systems. Micro cameras are small, lightweight & untethered from a computer are suitable for mobile applications or situations where size & weight might be an issue. A broad line of performance cameras with resolution, speed & light-sensitivity that can be used with industrial tools, digital cinema & HD television productions.","High speed photography is an engineering tool, much as is an oscilloscope or a computer. It is a photographic technique that enables us to visualize and analyze motion especially motions that are too fast for the human eye or conventional cameras to perceive.

During the first forty two years of the company's existence high speed photographic images were generally ""captured"" on photographic film. The company excelled in teaching and applying high speed photography to numerous clients for a multitude of applications. The company also designed , manufactured and marketed products specific to the high speed photographic needs of its clients. The company's film based cameras were so widely accepted that they are national stock listed (NSN) by the US DoD.

In 1992 the company decided to form a separate entity that was to design and fabricate high speed electronic imagers that did not rely on photographic film for imaging. That ""spin off"" was later to be known as Vision Research® Inc. and their More... family of electronic imagers is currently marketed under the ""Phantom®"" trade mark.

 Vision Research prides itself in the high resolution of its images, the power of its software, the reliability of its products and its high level of attentiveness and dedication to its customers. The company's innovative approach to high speed electronic ""digital"" imaging was recognized by the US Patent Office and was granted US Patent #5,625,412.

 The future holds more technology innovation and unique products from Vision Research. The company's development goals include electronic imaging products with higher resolution and faster frame rates and ""smarter"" cameras with more powerful and robust software.

 While hardware and software products are important, the company realizes that its key to future success is the same now as it was in 1950 and that is listening to and serving its customers.

UTC Aerospace Systems - ISR Systems,609-520-0610,http://www.sensorsinc.com,"Princeton, NJ 08540-5914",Manufacturer,"Manufacturer of indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) cameras and detectors for security, surveillance, military/defense, automated inspection, biomedical, spectroscopy, solar cell processing, art inspection, and more. Innovative products include fast-framing, high-resolution cameras, linescan imagers, and focal plane arrays which can image through fog, haze, and dust in daylight to starlight conditions. They feature easy-integration, use standard glass optics and require no cooling. Products are available fully packaged or as OEM modules. ISO 9001:2008 certified.","Founded in 1991 by Dr. Gregory Olsen as a state of the art research and development company, Sensors Unlimited Inc. is the leading manufacturer of Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) linear and area photodiode arrays and cameras for near infrared and shortwave infrared (SWIR) applications. Our experienced and knowledgeable staff and proficient manufacturing processes have led to Sensors' enviable reputation as the world's leader in SWIR imaging. 

Sensors Unlimited was acquired by Finisar Corporation in 2000. As the result of a management buyback in late 2002, we are once again a privately held company serving three major application areas: industrial, analytic, and scientific near infrared spectroscopy, machine vision and process control, and SWIR imaging and surveillance. Some specific examples include covert surveillance, ice detection, DWDM channel monitoring, laser beam profiling and medical imaging. Built on our InGaAs platform, our products include: SWIR cameras, 1- and 2-dimensional More... focal plane arrays, 10 Gb/s avalanche photodiodes (APDs) and custom designed structures and devices. 

 Our world class ISO 9001 certified manufacturing facility occupies more than 20,000 square feet including class 100 clean rooms and an MOCVD epitaxial growth facility. From custom design, material growth, fabrication and packaging, through the development of support electronics, Sensors Unlimited's commitment to total customer satisfaction allows us to provide the complete solution for all of your InGaAs photodetector needs.
