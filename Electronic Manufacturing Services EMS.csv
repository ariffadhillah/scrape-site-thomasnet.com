RoHS and REACH compliant. AS9100D certified.","For 40 years, ThermOmegaTech has been a leader in designing and manufacturing self-actuating temperature control valves and actuators. We serve many and, as a result, create solutions for a wide range of applications.

Beginning as the developer of highly reliable and cost-effective freeze valves for the railroad industry in 1983, ThermOmegaTech now provides the standard in freeze protection valves for the industry and takes pride in protecting billions of dollars of equipment annually.

In addition to solutions for the railroad industry, ThermOmegaTech's thermostatic valve and thermal actuator technology are used in Commercial Plumbing, Aerospace & Defense, and Industrial applications where temperature control is critical.

These applications include freeze protection, scald protection, steam traps, steam tracing, thermal relief, mixing & diverting, cooling fluid control, thermal bypass, thermal balancing, drain tempering, tepid water delivery, and many other applications where ambient, fluid, More... or surface temperatures affect a system.

 Our mixing valves designed for hot/cold water and steam/water applications have been incorporated into Washdown Stations for industrial cleaning, Instantaneous Hot Water Heaters, and Tepid Water Delivery Systems for safety showers and combination face/eyewash stations.

 In 2018, we expanded into the Electronics Contract Manufacturing market by acquiring a local PCB contract manufacturer, IMET Electronics Corporation. Then in 2019, we acquired a second manufacturer, TJM Electronics, and recently merged both brands into ThermOmegaTech.

 Over the past four years, we have invested many resources into our Electronics Division to learn about the industry and our customers from the 30+ years of PCBA experience our employees have had. We moved all employees and equipment into our manufacturing facility in Warminster, PA, located about an hour outside Philadelphia, so all company divisions operate from the same location, which has helped us streamline processes and improve communication channels.

 By combining ThermOmegaTech's expertise in phase-change technology, thermal actuator design, and valve manufacturing with our newly acquired printed circuit board assembly skills, we have broadened our offering to better support our customers' needs.

 Quality Control is our Top Priority

 Our entire team is dedicated to Lean Manufacturing Initiatives and striving to cultivate a culture of continuous improvement, evidenced by having our Quality Management System (QMS) certified ISO 9001 for over 2 decades and elevating that to reach AS9100D Certification since 2019. ThermOmegaTech also adheres to California's Proposition 65 requirements and meets RoHS and REACH compliance on required projects.

Suitable for transistor pads, insulators, horns, cabinets, baffles, phasing plugs, housings, covers and bezels. Meets ASTM, DOT and AS standards. UL listed. CE certified. REACH and RoHS compliant. FAA approved. ITAR registered.","Globe Plastics, Inc. was established on October 15, 1958 in Pomona, California by Roy and Marion Cramer. Roy was a retired engineer at General Dynamics. From that humble beginning Globe started a proprietary line of transistor pads that offered a low cost solution to problems associated with semi-conductor production handling and assembly. Globe manufactured its own tooling and became a leader in the electronics industry for many years. As the company's expertise grew in advanced engineering materials, Globe began compression and injection molding high strength composites for the aerospace/defense industry. In December, 1979, Globe purchased the Encapsulation Cup line from Polytop Corporation, located in Fullerton, CA. Then in 1982 Globe purchased the Encapsulation line from MG Precision Products of South El Monte, CA. Globe then had two proprietary lines consisting of thermoset and thermoplastic transistor pads and compression and transfer molded Encapsulation cups. In 1988 the company More... was acquired by entrepreneurs Nywood Wu and Clifton Chang to expand their existing base of defense based contract manufacturers. Being a minority owned composite molding firm, Globe was able to gain a larger share of the aerospace/defense industry. A position we still hold, 60 years later. In 1992, after the dramatic defense downturn, Globe began compression molding highly productive SMC and BMC materials to supply Globe Composites components for the sound and lighting industries. These materials and our processes proved to be far superior and a better value than existing thermoplastics and die cast aluminum components for the sound and lighting industries so Globe started penetrating these markets also. Since that time we have continued to expand our manufacturing capabilities, quality systems and process expertise. In 2004 we began a joint venture with Moldzen Precision in Dong Guan, China to form Globe Composites Far East where we have manufactured tooling for several years. We specialize in providing superior value in thermoset and thermoplastic molding of parts ranging in size from the head of a pin to a truck hood and anywhere in between. In 2008 Globe attained ISO 9001:2008 status and since then Globe has become AS 9100C certified firm and is listed on the Oasis database to give our customers and potential customers confidence relating to our quality, consistency and reliability.

Our mission is to make quality, technology, and low cost accessible at any volume.

Get your one specialty component made or consolidate your entire supply chain into one company by working with Scalar Manufacturing. You receive the flexibility and ease of a small firm but the manufacturing strength of a large company. Scalar Manufacturing gives its customers the simplicity of a one-stop shop and the low cost of separately sourcing each component, but without the costs associated with vertical integration.

Originally a printed circuit board and semiconductor packaging firm, Scalar Manufacturing added injection molding, die casting, and metal stamping to build housings for assembled PCBs. The last step is then to put everything together, and so Scalar Manufacturing offers cable assembly, electro-mechanical assembly, and finished product assembly. Due to the high overhead of many traditional processes, 3D Printing serves as More... a rapid prototyping service.

 Since we are primarily a manufacturer's representative, our products and services integrate seamlessly, but there is no associated overhead and thus no added cost. We can manufacture in volumes as low as 1, while our principals are capable of over 1 million pieces per month. Products are as simple as a bottlecap, or as complicated as a mobile device - PCB, housing manufacture, and final assembly.

Global operations and distribution centers in The Netherlands, Tokyo, Singapore, Sydney, and Silicon Valley (HQ).","For over 25 years, Extron has partnered with its clients to provide cutting-edge supply chain solutions designed to improve flexibility, reduce cost, and reduce risk. We specialize in the emerging field of last-mile manufacturing, plus order fulfillment solutions, returns-management solutions, and demo-loaner solutions.

Last mile manufacturing solutions allow manufacturers to postpone the installation and integration of critical, IP-sensitive, or volume-sensitive components until late in the supply chain - thus improving flexibility and adaptability to demand, reducing IP risk to overseas theft, reducing inventory and operations costs, and improving speed to market.

Global order fulfillment solutions can be coupled with last mile manufacturing solutions, where key integration and configuration steps can be performed immediately before the fulfillment stage.

Returns management solutions allow a company to maximize the value of returned product quickly, by refurbishing it and getting it back More... into inventory ""like new"" often within 24 hours.

 Demo-loaner solutions enhance a company's sales strategy by allowing a ""try before you buy"" option. Running these complex, logistics-intensive programs is difficult - but Extron makes it easy.

 All of these areas represent outsourced solutions that today's manufacturers desperately need - particularly those with long Asia-centric supply chains.
