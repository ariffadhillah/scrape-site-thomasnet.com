Protective covers and wire cages for control panels, strobe horn signals, smoke detectors, clocks, bells, keypads and fluorescent lights. Many UL, ULC, CUL, ADA and FM approved.","About Safety Technology International (STI)

STI is a family owned and operated business that began over forty years ago with Jack Taylor's invention of the StopperÂ® Pull Station Protector. Safety Technology now markets hundreds of unique products throughout the world to prevent false fire alarms and the theft and vandalism of the things that protect us all, such as smoke detectors, pull stations, horn/strobes, exit signs, and fire extinguishers.

With offices in Waterford, Michigan, Worcestershire, England, and Waterford, Ireland, the STI team has worked hard to continue the work that Jack Taylor started. STI's first product came directly at the request of a customer, Garnett Hegeman: a high school principal in Detroit, Michigan who had a problem with false fire alarms. Most new products throughout the years are a direct result of these types of requests. If you have a false fire alarm, theft, vandalism or other problem, STI invites you to contact them with the challenge of solving it. More...

Available ground fault protection products for temporary wiring on construction sites. Other products include grounding and bonding equipment such as mechanical ground clamps and assemblies, electronic ground monitoring and verification systems, ground fault circuit interrupters, and self-testing static grounding devices. Grounding clamps and assemblies comply with OSHA standards for controlling static charges. Products include portable and explosion proof work lights as well as low voltage lighting, fluorescent lighting, floodlights , fluorescent, halogen, high intensity, incandescent, stand and waterproof lights, fiber optic lighting and lamps as well as handheld and inspection lamps and flashlights.","Stewart R. Browne manufacturing company utilizes the latest technological advancements to provide static grounding and static bonding products, portable hazardous location lighting, and static ground monitoring systems that meet and exceed our customers' usages in atmospheres containing explosive gases, vapors and dust, and in which operator safety is the main consideration.

Having developed the first underwriters laboratories listed (UL) hazardous portable lighting products nearly a century ago, we are pleased to share the story of our commitment to delivering excellence in product and service as manufacturers and industry leaders.

Stewart R. Browne established the company in 1918, which is now a fourth-generation, family-owned and operated business.

An innovator and entrepreneur, Stewart started out as a salesman who purchased phenolic, an early form of plastic, in bulk for resale. Because the material could withstand exposure to petrochemicals, Stewart recognized the potential for industrial More... applications and built a new york manufacturing facility that produced piston rings, pump values, gears and other parts.

 Interestingly, the Sithsonian museum in Washington, DC displays Stewart R. Browne's products from that time period as examples of the earliest plastics. His invention of a modified phenolic compound later became the prototype for our patented tuffite the light, ultra safe, durable material that we currently use to make the handles of our portable lighting.

 Our next innovation was a line of static grounding and bonding clamps and assemblies for companies which produced or handled hazardous flammable materials. 

 Sons Robert and Stewart JR., the second generation, carried on their father's appreciation for ingenuity and quality. During WWII, Stewart JR. Worked closely with the navy and air force to develop explosion-proof lighting for use on aircraft and ships. Since that time, we have fostered a trusted relationship with the military by continuing to provide relevant, reliable solutions. Robert, for instance, took pride in accepting a military honor on behalf of the company for supplying quality products on time during the Vietnam war. Meanwhile, devising military applications furthered our advancements in safety lighting technology for more general use.

 In 1977 sons Alan and James took over as principals and moved the operations from New York to Georgia.

 Today, the third and fourth generations remain committed to serving our customers and to leading our industry in manufacturing and distributing static grounding and static bonding, a wide range of portable hazardous location lighting, and static ground monitoring systems for applications in which flammable or combustible materials are present.

 Our collaborations with the office of homeland security have additionally enabled us to serve various manufacturing facilities in meeting their needs. Less",,$1 - 4.9 Mil,10-49  Employees,"Alarms

Danaher designs, manufactures and markets, industrial and consumer products in both the Tool and Component and Process / Environmental Controls industries.

Our goal at Gems Sensors is to help you simplify and shorten your product design process by providing fluid sensor solutions that add value both to your product and your customers. Today, Gems manufactures hundreds of standard and custom products and employs a full staff of engineers, manufacturing personnel and technical sales associates. Gems has become the OEM's premier source for fluid sensors and controls.

History of Innovation and Growth:

The Gems Sensors & Controls (Gems) story began over 50 years ago in 1955 when the company founder, Edward H. Moore, developed a level indicator in his basement. It was patented in 1959. Along with an associate, Gordon Seigle, he established the Gems Company (GS for Gordon Seigle, EM for Ed Moore). Gems' More... first commercial success was a bilge switch for the small boating industry. Rapid acceptance of Gems' products for marine and industrial applications led to continual expansion of facilities and staff -- from a 6,500 sq. ft. building to a facility of 60,000 sq. ft. in Plainville, Connecticut, USA. 

 Today, Gems designs and manufactures a broad portfolio of liquid level, flow switches and pressure switches, miniature solenoid valves, and pre-assembled fluidic systems. Gems is a division of Danaher Corporation, a fortune 500 company with a presence around the globe. Gems Sensors and Controls has manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe, and Asia and supports sales, engineering and service offices around the world. Gems has the resources to support your design and manufacturing requirements anywhere you call home. 

 The Gems Sensors & Controls Advantage:

 Gems delivers personal attention, engineering expertise, and technical support to reduce development risks, improve the understanding of design issues, and quickly identify the right solutions. Decades of application engineering provides the perspective and experience to quickly prototype, build, and deliver components, sub-assemblies or systems exactly to your critical requirements. 

 Research and development teams simulate actual application environments and perform rigorous environmental testing. Each fluidic component and sub-assembly is individually designed and 100 percent pre-tested for specific applications from liquid to pneumatic, cryogenic to high temperature or vacuum to high-pressure systems. Experience has taught us which technologies and product characteristics provide effective solutions to customers' problems. 

 There's a good chance we've already dealt with the design criteria you're working on and will probably have a product solution available right off the shelf. That saves you both time and money! Less",,$100 - 249.9 Mil,200-499  Employees,"Alarms

ENCON Evaporators,603-624-5110,https://www.evaporator.com/,"Hooksett, NH 03106",Manufacturer,"Custom manufacturer of evaporators including mechanical vapor compression, waste oil and wastewater, industrial wastewater thermal and drum evaporators. Other evaporator types include crystallizing, continuous, experimental, low temperature, multiple effect, submerged combustion, thin film, vacuum, water distilling, high concentration and recompression type evaporators. Evaporators are available with control systems including modems or network hubs for remote dial-in, troubleshooting or monitoring purposes. Accessories include actuated ball valves, centrifugal and air diaphragm pumps, level controls, audible and visual alarms, condensers and cone bottom tanks. Evaporators are suitable for use in a wide variety of applications including ion exchange regeneration waste, heavy equipment cleaning, aircraft washing and deicing, stamping and drawing, vat cleaning and ultrafiltration. Capabilities include wastewater treatment, regulatory compliance and engineering services.","ENCON Evaporators designs, manufactures, and distributes wastewater evaporators. Evaporation technology offers the simplest and most effective approach to industrial wastewater minimization. ENCON Wastewater Evaporators are able to handle a wide range of waste streams simultaneously and are a great option for manufacturing processes that may expand or change in the future.

Many companies that generate industrial wastewater are hauling their water for disposal at a high cost per gallon. Other companies are treating the wastewater, often with labor and chemical intensive processes, and are having to adhere to increasingly strict discharge limits to their local sewer authority.

ENCON Drum and Thermal Evaporators offer an alternative to hauling and treating by safely evaporating wastewater to atmosphere at a dramatically lower cost. ENCON Mechanical Vapor Compression (MVC) Evaporators recover and recycle wastewater as distilled water for reuse or discharge to the sewer. ENCON MVC Evaporators More... are very energy efficient with typical energy costs in the range of $0.01  0.02 per gallon of distilled water. Finally, the ENCON Drum Dryer will efficiently dewater concentrated residues to a dry condition, in most cases, for landfill disposal.

 All ENCON systems are designed to operate off shift and unattended to minimize manpower requirements and cost. ENCON Sales Engineers will work with you to qualify applications based on ENCON lab and pilot scale testing. The ENCON approach is consultative with special focus on providing solutions with financial justification and regulatory compliance. 

 If your waste stream is substantially water (70-99%), it is likely to be an excellent application for ENCON wastewater evaporators. Common wastestreams for evaporation include: air scrubber wastewater solution, compressor condensate wastewater treatment, dye penetrant wastewater treatment, ink, paint, and glue wastewater solution, landfill leachate solution, metal finishing wastewater solution, parts cleaning wastewater solution, plating rinse wastewater solution, spent coolant wastewater solution, zero liquid discharge wastewater solution, reverse osmosis reject waste streams, water soluble coolants, mop water, vibratory & tumbling waste, die cast waste, machining coolants, ion exchange regeneration waste, wire drawing, aqueous cleaners, alkaline cleaners, acid cleaners, boiler blowdown, etching compounds, pressure washing, storm runoff, heavy equipment cleaning, glycol (ethylene and propylene), oil/gas production well water, rail/tank car washwaters, stamping and drawing, heat treat quench water, floor scrubber wastewater, cooling tower water, powder coating washwater, steam cleaning washwater, truck washing, groundwater remediation, oily wastewater, electroplating rinses, lapping solutions, aircraft washing and deicing, engine rebuilding wash, film processing wastewater, pharmaceuticals, printing waste, paint spray booth rinse, ultrafiltration concentrate.

Customer Focus

Johnstone Supply dedicates itself to providing the highest quality products and service to our customers. To ensure we can meet the challenges of a dynamic industry, our company quickly develops and adapts programs to fulfill customer needs on a national and regional scale, while our individual stores customize these programs for their local markets.

The Johnstone Supply Catalog

Ever-growing product depth and quality plus ongoing improvements to the Johnstone Supply Catalog guarantee its continued status as the best source in the HVACR industry for parts, supplies and equipment. Available both in print and online with detailed illustrations and specifications, the online catalog features more than 50,000 quality products from the top manufacturers in the business, with more added every day.

Industry Expertise

Johnstone Supply views education as an essential, powerful tool that gives our stores and their valued customers a distinct competitive advantage. More... Our Johnstone University program offers intensive technical and business seminars to store owners and personnel, ensuring we have the most experienced, knowledgeable and helpful counter staff in the industry. To make continuing education even more effective we have developed Internet courseware to bring product training and expertise to the staff at our stores anywhere in the country, accessible round the clock.

 For our contractor and technician customers, Johnstone stores offer numerous educational opportunities to help propel them to the forefront of their profession, including onsite, hands-on technical training classes and NATE certification both in-store and online.

 Unmatched Supplier Relationships

 The HVACR industry is in a period of tremendous change. Consolidation has become the norm rather than the exception, and small, privately owned businesses are quickly disappearing. The Johnstone Supply Cooperative is uniquely equipped to meet this challenge in ways that are beneficial to our customers. We pride ourselves on having close, mutually beneficial relationships with the top manufacturers around the country, making sure our customers have access to the best products at competitive prices at every Johnstone store.

Easy mounting brackets, mounting magnets, and disc guards are also available. Five-year warranty on most standard products.","Electro-Sensors, Inc. began operations in 1968 in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. It was founded by James P. Slattery to serve material handling and process control applications in industrial plants. The original products included the Bin-Levetrol level sensor which sensed presence or absence of material and functioned as a high or low level control for bins or hoppers used in dry bulk material handling systems. Another core product was a speed monitor for monitoring critical shaft speeds and was used on conveyor belts, screw conveyors, bucket elevators, and similar process equipment. This speed monitor would shut off the driven equipment if proper speed was not maintained. 

As the company grew, other sensing technologies and products were added to monitor temperature, vibration, or position in industrial applications. These products include shaft speed sensors, shaft speed switches, bearing temperature sensors, belt misalignment devices, vibration switches, position monitors for slide gates More... and valves, tilt switches, motor speed controllers, and complete hazard monitoring systems for processing plants.

 Electro-Sensors, Inc. consistently produces the most reliable speed control and motion detection systems available, utilizing leading-edge technology to continuously improve our products and make them easier to use. Our goal is to manufacture the industry-preferred product for every market we serve. We do this through total quality commitment, by completely fulfilling our customers' expectations.

 Electro-Sensors, Inc. contributes real value to the marketplace by providing complete, ready-to-install systems. These systems are delivered promptly and are supported by knowledgeable technical support, providing total customer service. We appreciate our many loyal customers who depend upon our products every day to help run their plants with greater efficiency, productivity, and control.

 No matter how unique or complex your manufacturing environment, chances are that Electro-Sensors has encountered a similar challenge.
